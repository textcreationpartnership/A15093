            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I firſt pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned this Treatiſe, which now I offer to your Lordſhips, I did it for mine owne priuate exerciſe, and the ſatisfying of certaine friends that deſired it. Afterward ſeeing ſome hope that it might doe good abroad, principally in the countrey where I dwell: and deſirous, if it were poſsible, to do any thing that might helpe the ſeduced out of their errors, and confirme the reſt in the truth, I was eaſily perſwaded to put it forth; and the rather for that the queſtions handled, touching <hi>THE AVTHORITIE AND SENCE OF THE SCRIPTVRE,</hi> and <hi>SIGNES OF THE CHVRCH,</hi> are the profitableſt that can be ſtood vpon, and ſuch as I haue alway obſerued our people commonlieſt vſe, and moſt deſire to looke into; not being able to apprehend the difference, or iudge of the reaſons in other
<pb facs="tcp:1857:3"/> queſtions; but preſuming that if by certain marks they could find which is the true Church, there would remaine litle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie in the reſt, forſomuch as therein they ſhould find the truth in euery controuerſie.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> The proper cauſe why our aduerſaries put this deuice into the peoples heads, was to dazle their eyes, and delude their ſences with the name of <hi>THE CHVRCH;</hi> that when they ſhould find the word of God, and all diſcourſe againſt their opinions, yet that name ſhould amaze them, while they might beleeue nothing vntill they were perſwaded, by other marks, that it came from the <hi>CHVRCH.</hi> And no doubt this is the<note n="a" place="margin">Apollodor. Bibliothec. li. 2.</note> Gorgons head that inchanteth and oppreſſeth them, euen the learnedſt of them all, and holdeth them in bondage to their errors, hauing a conceit that they wil heare nothing againſt the Church: which they preſuming to be the Papacy (though it be but <hi>AN IMPOSTVME BRED IN THE CHVRCH,</hi> or <hi>A DISEASE GROWING TO IT</hi>) will go no further. All their ſpeech is of the Church: no mention of the Scriptures, or God their Father, but their <hi>MOTHER THE CHVRCH.</hi> Much like as<note n="b" place="margin">Solin. poly. hiſt. c. 33.</note> they write of certaine Aethiopians, that <hi>by reaſon they vſe no mariage, but promiſcuouſly companie together, it cometh that the children onely follow the mother: the fathers name is in no requeſt, but the mother goeth away with all the reputation.</hi> Let their talke be listened, and their bookes peruſed, and it will appeare, this authoritie of their Church is at the end of euery queſtion, and ſtriketh the ſtroke: as<note n="c" place="margin">Philoſtrat. in imaginib.</note> one ſaith pleaſantly of Aeſops Fables, that <hi>therein the Foxe is the chiefe ſtickler of all the company.</hi> The beaſts ſeldom meet but he is among them, and beareth his part with the buſieſt.</p>

               <hi>3</hi> This matter is handled in this Booke betweene my aduerſarie and me. For though others haue done the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:1857:3"/> before me, yet I haue done it in mine owne method. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all one, but the veſſell wherein I haue brought it, is my owne.

            <p n="4">4 Hauing therefore to do with aduerſaries ſo contentious, with doctrine ſo pernicious, with a Church ſo diſeaſed; it is a better way to examine the queſtions and betake our ſelues to the true part, then to hope for that which will not be. And this was the courſe that the Chriſtians tooke when the Church in ancient times was vexed with Arianiſme and Pelagianiſme. They were not indifferent which ſide preuailed, but they claue faſt to the truth: they
<pb facs="tcp:1857:9"/> did not neutralize betweene both; they did not idly ſit, and deride thoſe that contended for the truth; they made not the queſtions of religion the matter of their quarrels, and rude diſcourſe in Tauernes and ſtreetes, and euery baſe companie; but with godly affection they lamented the Churches trouble, and with zealous conſciences, and earneſt prayer, and religious endeuour they ſought the faith. This is the way that all men ſhould take, now when the rumor of the contention groweth ſo great: 1. with HVMILITIE to craue at Gods hand the direction of his Spirit: 2. then with DILIGENCE to reade and learne the Scripture, whereby to iudge: 3. and ſo with LOVE to the perſons of the men, and with a mind prepared to yeeld to the truth, to trauell through the queſtions. The want of which no doubt is the true cauſe why contentions grow, and queſtions multiply, and all things are vncertain. For the preachings and writings of learned men are licentiouſly cenſured afore they be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: the moſt people making the ſame onely a matter to cauill at; neuer conſidering with what religious hands they ought to touch the queſtions of faith, wherin whoſoeuer erreth, loſeth no leſſe then his ſoule thereby. The queſtions of faith, and all matters of religion, require in ſuch as will profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly exerciſe themſelues therein, three things: <hi>Humilitie</hi> of mind, becauſe they concern the holy things of God: <hi>Diligence</hi> in attending, becauſe they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcerned: and <hi>ſtrength of iudgement,</hi> becauſe enemies and ſeducers are exceeding cunning to beguile a ſlothfull examiner, and deceiue him that conſidereth not attentiuely.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Our aduerſaries that manage the Papacie, if euer any, haue expreſſed this cunning and skill in perſwading and ſetting forth their hereſie, ſo farre that it cannot be denied, they haue omitted no art that might ſet it forth, nor no diligence that might adorne it. We reade ſtrange things of certaine pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how admirably they caſt and ſhadowed their workes; but the skilfulleſt painters that euer were are our Ieſuits and Schoolmen, and others, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for the Church of Rome. Not the famous Zeuxis (<note n="t" place="margin">Plin. l. 35 c. 9.</note> who wrote vnder his table, when he had drawne it, that <hi>men ſhould ſooner enuy then imitate him</hi>) was to be compared to theſe painters: not the ancient Polignotus, nor Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaſius, not Mycon, Timanthes, Bularchus, Phidias, did euer beſtow ſuch pains on their images, as theſe haue done on their idol the Papacie: ſpecially the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, who, as Plinie<note n="u" place="margin">Lib. 35. c. 10.</note> noteth of Parthaſius, is <hi>ſoecundus artifex, ſed quo nemo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolentius &amp; arrogantius ſit vſus gloria artis: a workman full of deuice, but no man vſeth the reputation of his skil more proudly and arrogantly then he.</hi> Zeuxis being to make the image of Iuno, to hang vp in her temple, choſe out certain virgins, to put the ſeuerall beautie of them all into his picture: ſo haue theſe painters made choiſe of the exquiſiteſt deuices that all the hereſy in the world could yeeld, to put the ſame into their religion; no policie in Machiauell, nor Sophiſtry in Ariſtotle, nor eloquence in Rhetorick, but they haue contriued it into their Image, that, ſaue <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſinceritie,</hi> there is nothing wanting. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian ſaith, <hi>As the Gentiles with their hands, ſo heretickes with their words, are the makers of idols: for euery lie that they ſpeake of God, is a kind of idolatry.</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:1857:10"/> Prophet Eſay<note n="x" place="margin">C. 44. v. 12.</note> ſetteth downe a liuely deſcription of this matter. <hi>The Smith ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an inſtrument, and worketh in the coles, and faſteneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the ſtrength of his armes: the Carpenter ſtretcheth out a line, he faſhioneeh it with a thred, and plaineth it, and pourtrayeth it with the compaſſe, and maketh it after the figure of a man, and according to the beauty of a man, that it may remaine in a houſe. He heweth him downe Cedars, and Pine trees, and Okes, and he taketh thereof and burneth it, and warmeth himſelfe, and baketh his bread: yet he maketh a god and worſhippeth it, an idol and boweth downe before it: he burneth the halfe of it in the fire, and vpon the half of it he eateth his meate; he roſteth it, and is ſatisfied: alſo he warmeth himſelfe, and ſaith Aha, I am warm, I haue bin at the fire; and the reſidue therof he maketh a god, euen his idol; wherto he boweth, yea he worſhippeth and prayeth vnto it ſaying, Deliuer me, for thou art my god.</hi> In which words the God of heauen deriding the Gentile, doth very fitly ſhew vs the idolatry of Rome, and the maner how the idol religion therof was framed and ſet on foote. At the firſt it was but a rude block, and ragged trunk, rough hewne by bungling workmen that were not their crafts maſters, till the Smith, the Carpenter, and the painter came, euery one in his place, and ſhewed his skill. Firſt the Canoniſts like blackſmiths blew with the bellowes of their Decrees, and hammered, and heat it in the coles of the Popes Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions: theſe ſmithes were Gratian, Pope Iohn, Gregory, and Boniface, with their prentiſes that ſerued them, Hoſtienſis, Innocent, Panormitane, and the reſt of that profeſſion. Next, the Carpenters that tooke it in hand were the Friers and Schoolmen, which ſtretched their line ouer it, and brought it into better ſhape. Thomas, and Scot, and Alexander faſhioned it with line and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, they ſtretched out the line of Method ouer it, and with the thred of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction they plained it where it was rough, and with the compaſſes of their Logick and Philoſophy made it in the faſhion of a man. After that the great Lateran Councell, about the yeare 1215. had poliſhed it, and giuen it ſtrong ioynts to ſtand vpon: not long after the Councels of Conſtance, Baſil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Lateran hewed it ouer again, and altered the faſhion in certain points touching the Popes authoritie. There ſome Cardinals, Senenſis and Cuſanus, thought the head ſtood too high aboue the ſhoulders, and would haue had it bowed downe a little lower. At laſt they brought it to Trent, into the hands of their beſt workmen, as<note n="y" place="margin">Abſolutiſſima Trident. Synod. Poſſeuin bibli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth. ſelect. pag. 18.

There is no colour but they haue tried it to make it beautifull. Some with varniſh and plaiſter ſtop vp the crackes, which the Sunne ſhining vpon it, hath made, that they might not be ſeene Bellarmine and his aſſociates in that kind, ſtirre all colours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and varniſh ouer the ſmokie and duſtie places ſo skilfully, that a man can ſcarce tell what the colour is. Surius and Baronius with other colours, ground by Legendaries, caſt a ſhadow ouer it for ſeeming too youthfull, but they haue painted a gray beard to a greene head: the reſt ſtand by, ſuch as are
<pb facs="tcp:1857:10"/> Sixtus Senenſis, Lindan, Staphylus, Poſſeuine, like Cenſors, commending the workmanſhip, and flattering the workmen, and extolling the idoll againſt them they call Lutherans and Caluiniſts. Thus at the laſt haue they poliſhed their Dagon, and ſet it vp before the Lords Arke: ſaue that it may not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that with ſome of it they warme themſelues, and roſt their meate; as Pardons, the Maſſe, and Purgatorie; and laugh in their ſleeues at ſuch as turne the ſpit: <hi>Ah I am warme, I haue bin at the fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 This is the labor and workmanſhip that our aduerſaries haue beſtowed on their religion, to ſet it forth: whereby they haue made their Church ſo ſeeming Catholicke. And indeed we haue alwayes obſerued that there be two principall things which draw mens conceits to Papiſtrie. The firſt is the Name and report that goeth of the Church of Rome, while men perſwade themſelues that a Church ſo ancient, and renowmed in all ages, cannot but be the true Church of God. The ſecond is the rumour and opinion of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries learning, as if it were vnpoſſible ſo learned men ſhould be deceiued, and their writings could be anſwered. Neuertheleſſe it is eaſie enough to ſee the truth through all this, if men will conſider of things attentiuely. For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the name and ſhew of the ROMANE CHVRCH, it is but an empty ſound of words and titles: this preſent Romane being wholly departed, in the queſtions controuerted, from the ancient, and retaining nothing but the title. This ſhould deceiue no man. For the true, ancient, and Apoſtolicke Church of Rome, ſo much commended by the Fathers, and ſought to by the world, profeſſed another kind of faith then this doth, and the ſame that now we defend againſt them; whereas this is fallen from it; and yet skilfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtill the ſame Seate and Title, impoſeth maruellouſly vpon the world hereby. Iſidorus Peluſiota<note n="b" place="margin">L. 3. Epiſt. 408.</note> hath a ſaying that ſheweth the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of this: <hi>In the daies of the Apoſtles, and afterward, when the Church floriſhed, and laboured as yet of no diſeaſe, the diuine graces of God went, as it were in a ring, round about it; the holy Ghoſt adminiſtring all things, and all the Biſhops thereof inciting and turning it towards heauen: afterwards it grew diſeaſed, and was troubled with faction, and then all thoſe things flew away. Thus the Church is like a woman fallen from her ancient happineſſe, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning onely ſome ſignes thereof. She hath the ſheathes and caskets where her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lay, but the goods themſelues ſhe is ſpoiled of. Not through his careleſneſſe and negligence that firſt enriched her, but through their naughtineſſe that gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not things as they ſhould haue done.</hi> This Doctor well perceiued that a Church may loſe the faith, and yet retaine her name ſtill: and he ſaw that, in his time, things fell to decay, and the faith of Chriſt began to be altered. To what purpoſe then ſhould any man reſpect the name of the Romane Church, when the true faith is changed? or what do the prerogatiues and royalties of the ancient Church concerne this that is turned to another reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? or who regardeth a houſe of ſtately building, and honorable title, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke memory ſince Iohn of Gaunt, when the plague hath infected it, and theeues poſſeſſe it?

               <hi>in the matter of faith are nothing behinde the elder Romanes. For in the Church of God there is nothing to be reckoned before the reſt. Wherefore let Saint Paul glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in vs alſo, and ioyning new things with old, and comparing vs in doctrines and preaching, let him glory in vs both alike.

            <p n="7">7 The ſecond point that deceiueth manie, is the rumour and opinion that goeth of our aduerſaries learning: which is as weake a motiue to build on, as the former; when the greateſt heretickes that euer were haue wanted no learning, and we may be ſure, this of our aduerſaries is not commended with the leaſt. Themſelues are vnmeaſurable, and more then odious in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling their owne facultie, and their people as ridiculous and irkeſome in reporting it It is nothing beſeeming Chriſtians to leaue the cauſe, and to fall a boaſting.

               </gap>, omitting the way that is by triall of arguments, I offer cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine externall markes, and ſenſible tokens whereby the falſhood of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church may be diſcouered, &amp; the moſt reſolute Papiſt that liueth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to miſdoubt his owne religion: for it is vnpoſſible that theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhould be found in the true Church, or practiſed by men of the right faith. The firſt is, their enmitie with the ſacred Scriptures, the word of God: whereof I haue ſpoken in the 22. Digreſſion of this booke. For the words<note n="l" place="margin">Eſa. 8.20.</note> of the Prophet are cleare: <hi>To the Law, to the Teſtimony: if they ſpeake not according to that word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi> And one of their practiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it whereby they haue depriued it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being the totall rule; hath left the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly voide of all meanes to ſecure their faith by, and to find the truth. For the Church, the fathers the Councels, the Pope, which is all they can pretend, are yeelded by themſelues to be ſubiect to error. And how can that giue them aſſurance of their faith, which it ſelfe is not aſſured from error? The ſecond is the very face and outward ſtate, and gouernment of their Church, cleane contrary to the firſt antiquitie. How vnlike is their Pope to Peter? their Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to the Apoſtles? their Prelates to the ancient Biſhops; in ſtate, in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in intermedling? This is noted at large by many among themſelues. Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barella, Cuſanus, Marſilius, Occham, Duarenus. How vnlike is their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb facs="tcp:1857:14"/> Maſſe, halfe Communion, Latin Seruice, Image worſhip, to the ancient Seruice of the Church of God? If it were the true Church, no continuance of time could thus haue altered it: age changeth the colour of a mans haire, and the ſound of his voice, but not his complexion or the ſhape of his bodie. The third is, that THERE IS NO POINT OF OVR FAITH BVT MANY LEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED IN THEIR OWNE CHVRCH HOLD IT WITH VS, AND NO POINT OF PAPISTRIE THAT WE HAVE REIECTED, BVT SOME OF THEMSELVES HAVE MISLIKED IT AS WELL AS WE. And this may be demonſtrated in all the queſtions that are betweene vs, and they know it, and for that cauſe haue purged and razed the principall bookes of the elder Papiſts, and ſome of them they haue vtterly forbidden. <hi>In the bookes of latter Catholickes alſo,</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Index libro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum prohib. p. 25. §. 3.</note> ſaith the Index, <hi>which were written ſince the yeare</hi> 1515. <hi>if that which needeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting can be amended by taking away or adding of a few things, let the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſee it be done: but otherwiſe let it be wholly razed out.</hi> The fourth is, that the moſt points of Papiſtrie are directly and at the firſt ſight abſurd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt common ſence, and the law of nature. For who can conceiue that it ſhould be the <hi>Popes</hi> right to Lord it thus ouer the Scriptures, Fathers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, Church, and all the world? What poſſibility is there that the kingdomes of the world ſhould be ſubiect to him? What likelyhood is there that <hi>Images</hi> ſhould be worſhipped? our <hi>workes</hi> ſhould merit heauen? the <hi>cup</hi> ſhould not be allowed to the people? the <hi>Seruice</hi> ſhould be in a language vnknowne? the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> ſhould be in ten thouſand places at once? the Prieſt ſhould haue iudiciall power to <hi>forgiue ſinnes?</hi> the <hi>Saints</hi> in heauen ſhould be made mediators for vs to God. He that will indifferently compare theſe and many points more ſhall finde them manifeſtly againſt the principles of religion, and the light of nature. What man can thinke it to be the true Church that teacheth to <hi>equiuocate,</hi> to <hi>murther the King,</hi> to <hi>pay no debts,</hi> to BLOW VP THE PARLIAMENT, to diſpenſe with <hi>murther</hi> and <hi>whoredome?</hi> The fift is, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate and vnchriſtian proceeding againſt vs. For if they were of the truth, they would not defend themſelues, and confute vs with groſſe lying, vncharitable railing, and irreconcileable malice, which are the weapons of darkeneſſe; but with grauitie and ſinceritie as becometh Chriſts Goſpell. Who will beleeue that any can be ſo impious, that holdeth there is a God, as to make him <hi>the author of ſinne?</hi> and yet<note n="n" place="margin">Poſſeuin. bibl. ſelect. p. 533.</note> they ſhame not to ſay we do it.

                  <l>For in the mount of Caluary there thou was firſt found:</l>
                  <l>Thou healedſt our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and ſtanchedſt his bleeding wound:</l>

               </q> And ſo they pluck it vp, and weare it. Their prayers and traditions of this ſort are infinite, and the ceremonies they vſe in all their actions are nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Gentiles in number and ſtrangeneſſe. Which any man may eaſily obſerue that conuerſeth with them: the Which I haue noted in this place, not to diſgrace the perſons of any, but to ſhew the pitiful barbarouſneſſe wherein they liue that refuſe to heare the Goſpell, and whom our Seminaries haue trained vp, boaſting that there is no religion, or knowledge, or deuotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, but in theſe people. And let any man iudge how it can poſſibly be the Church of Chriſt, that nouriſheth this barbarous, and more then brutiſh ignorance &amp; ſuperſtition among the people. And it cannot be anſwered, that theſe are the cuſtomes of a few ſimple people: for this that I ſay, is generall throughout the country, the whole bodie of the common people practiſing nothing elſe, vntill it pleaſe God by the miniſtery of his Goſpell to conuert them. Yea the moſt men and women addicted to Papiſtry, though wel borne and brought vp for ciuill qualities, and of good place in the countrey, yet lie plunged in this ignorance, being perſwaded that what they haue learned by
<pb facs="tcp:1857:16"/> long cuſtome and continuance in their old religion (ſo they ſtyle it) they ſhould not giue ouer. Yea this ſore is ſo foule and grieuous, that it may not endure to be looked into.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This brutiſh condition of their people may the better be credited, and is the leſſe to be wondred at, becauſe the open practiſe of their Church giueth them example, and encourageth them by their idolatry and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion toward the Saints departed. For how can that people diſcerne their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, whoſe Paſtors euen before their eies, in their open Seruice and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted bookes, ſerue the Saints and worſhip them with the ſame ſeruice that they giue to Chriſt?

Secondly it muſt be ſuch as may be eaſily and plainly knowne to all ſorts, learned and vnlearned. For otherwiſe be it neuer ſo certaine and ſure in it ſelfe, yet if it be vnknowne, or vncertainely knowne vnto them, it cannot be to them a rule or infallible meane whereby they may attaine to the infallible knowledge of the true faith. Thirdly it muſt be moſt vniuerſall, that it may not onely make vs know certainly what is the true faith in ſome one, or two, or more points, but abſolutely in all points of faith. For otherwiſe it is not a ſufficient rule whereby we may attaine to an entire faith; which integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of faith is neceſſarie to ſaluation, as hath bene proued.</p>

               <p n="1">1 To theſe three properties of the rule of faith, we muſt adde two more, if we will ſhew all the nature thereof. Firſt, that it be not partiall, addicted more to one ſide then another. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it be of power and authority, able to conuince the conſcience of ſuch as vſe it, and from the which there can be no appeale. For neither can it be a rule of the truth, which it ſelfe is crooked with affection, neither may we ſafely rely vpon it, if either it diſmiſſe our conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wauering, or admit a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rule whereto we may appeale. And the reaſon is, becauſe our faith and knowledge muſt be<note n="m" place="margin">Col. 2.2. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil. Reg. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. qu. 95.</note>

               <p n="2">2 Next the ſecond property muſt be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nded; that the rule be eaſie and plaine to all ſorts of men learned and vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to wit, which vſe the means, and are diligent in attending it, &amp; be enlightned by the ſpirit of God. To all ſuch it is plaine be they neuer ſo vnlearned: to the reſt it is not; neither is it a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1857:29"/> neceſſary condition of the rule ſo to be. Not becauſe it ſelfe is obſcure at any time, but for that ſometimes men haue not eyes to ſee into it. For all meanes and rules are vaine, vnleſſe God giue eyes to ſee: as<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 21.19.</note>

               <p n="1">1 This concluſion hath two parts. Firſt, that the Scripture is not the rule which God hath left to inſtruct vs in the points of faith. Next that if poſſible it were, yet, as we haue it tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1857:30"/> into Engliſh, it cannot. Whereto I anſwer, that the doctrine of our Church is,<note n="t" place="margin">

                  </note> that the <hi>Scriptures comprehended in the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical books of the old and new Teſtament, is the rule of faith ſo far that whatſoeuer is not read therein, or cannot be proued thereby, is not to be accepted as any point of faith, or needfull to be followed;</hi> but by it all doctrines taught, and the Churches practiſe muſt be examined, and that reiected which is contrary to it, vnder what title or pretence ſoeuer it come vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And as for tranſlations, we ſay that the diuine truth which is the infallible word of God, is alike conteined in all tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the meanes to ſhew it vs, and the veſſels wherein it is preſented to vs: yet with this difference, that the ſame is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, immediatly, &amp; moſt abſolutely, in the originall Hebrew and Greeke; all other tranſlations being to be tryed by them. And therefore<note n="*" place="margin">Sacrae Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae infallibilis per omnia au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegerrima in omnibus veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, non pendet ex omnimoda incorruptibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate alicuius e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis, ſed eius incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilitas omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moda in corde Eccleſiae ita conſeruatur, vt cum opus ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit opportunè prouideat, ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos<expan>

                  <hi>we relie vpon tranſlations but in a certaine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and degree; namely with this caution, that we trie them by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, and finding them to agree in the matter, we hold the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation to be the ſame canonicall Scripture that the Greek and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is.</hi> Thus we ſay, that <hi>euery tranſlation conſenting with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall is canonicall Scripture, becauſe the matter of it is the pure doctrine of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and this doctrine conteined in it, is the rule we ſeeke for. Otherwiſe, in the rigor of ſpeech, we cannot call the Engliſh tranſlation the rule, no not yet the Greeke and Hebrew; becauſe all language and writing is but a ſymbole or declaration of the rule, and a certaine forme, or manner, or meanes, whereby it cometh to vs, as things are conteyned in their words. And ſo to conclude, becauſe the doctrine &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the text is not made knowne to me but by the words &amp; language, therefore I ſay the ſcripture tranſlated into Engliſh, is the rule of faith: whereupon I relying, haue not a humane but a diuine authoritie. For euen as I beleeue a diuine truth, although by humane voice in preaching it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to me; ſo I enioy the infallible doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, immediatly inſpired by the holy Ghoſt, though by a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tranſlation it be manifeſted to me. And this is our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when we call the Scriptures tranſlated into Engliſh, the rule. Which being explaned, I will put the Reader in mind of

               <p n="1">1 This ſection containeth the Ieſuites firſt argument, to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1857:35"/> proue that the Scriptures tranſlated into Engliſh cannot be the rule of faith: and thus it may be concluded:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The rule is infallible and free from error.</p>
                  <p>But the Engliſh tranſlation is not infallible and free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the Engliſh tranſlation is not the rule.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Whereunto I briefly anſwer two things: the firſt is, that the concluſion may be granted; for we do not thinke this or that tranſlation to be the rule and iudge, but onely that it is a means whereby the diuine truth, which is the rule, is made knowne to vs: for we put a difference betweene the doctrine taught in the Scripture, and the meanes whereby the doctrine is vttered to our capacitie, as betweene things and words. The former is the rule, the latter the veſſell wherein the rule is preſented to vs, which in the originall is perfect, but in all tranſlations defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue more or leſſe. See my anſwer to §. 5. nu. 1. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Next, to the argument, that our tranſlations are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, I anſwer, <hi>An edition or tranſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion of the Scripture may be erronious many wayes, and one way is in reſpect of the words onely and not of the ſence: for ſo it may be corrupt, that is to ſay, not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo perfect as it ſhould be. Now this doth nothing hinder the truth of the matter, or the integritie of the text.</hi> This diſtinction is<note n="a" place="margin">Relect. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cip. doctrin. contriou 5. q. 3. art. 3. pag. 525.</note> D. Stapletons, and therefore the Ieſuite muſt admit it, and it is the truth: for no tranſlation can fully expreſſe the idiom or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the originall language, and words and phraſes may be defectiue, and all ſecondary cauſes haue their impediments, all which may in their kind be truly called errors: and we deny not but our Engliſh tranſlation, and the Latin vulgar too, is ſubiect to them; but this hindereth not the truth of the matter, nor the perfection of the text, ſaith D. Stapleton.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And therefore that which the Ieſuite vrgeth againſt our tranſlations, is of no force, becauſe it proueth no error in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but inwards onely, as I haue ſaid before: for we graunt as he ſaith, <hi>the Scripture was not written immediatly in Engliſh, neither was the tranſlator aſſisted by the holy Ghoſt in ſuch ſort that he could not erre in any point, but being a man be might erre:</hi> for he might erre in his owne worke which he did himſelfe, viz. in words and proprieties; but in the matter contained,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1857:36"/> which is Gods work, he could not, holding him to the originall Hebrew and Greeke, which our tranſlator did; or at the leaſt it was not vnpoſſible but he might truly and faithfully tranſlate without any new inſpiration, though he were a man otherwiſe ſubiect to error: becauſe the originall might leade him, and many other meanes might direct and admoniſh him, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his error; elſe what will the Ieſuit ſay when an ordinarie Paſtor preacheth Gods word to the people? For that which he deliuereth may be free from error, and yet his voice is a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane worke, and himſelfe hath no immediate or infallible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. The very ſame reaſon is there of tranſlations: for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine work propounded by a humane meanes may be free from error; which I further proue by Bellarmines owne confeſſion, who ſpeaking of the vulgar Latin,<note n="b" place="margin">Admittimus enim interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non eſſe prophetam, &amp; errare potuiſſe, tamen dicimus eum no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erraſſe in illa verſione quam eccleſia proba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now the Church hath allowed our Engliſh, and we ſay ours is the true Church; and therefore the tranſlator, though he were but a man, did not erre. Againe, thus I reaſon: if the Latin tranſlator were freed from erring, that is to ſay, might erre, but yet did not; then our Engliſh tranſlator may be freed likewiſe, becauſe he hath the ſame meanes: for if the approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church exempted him, ours alſo hath the ſame approbation: but that could not exempt him, for it was extant, and therefore was free from error, if euer it were ſo at al,<note n="c" place="margin">It began to be receiued about the time of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory the great (who entred his Papacy in the yeare 590) ſaith Baron. annal. to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>2.</hi> an. <hi>231.</hi> nu <hi>47.</hi> but was neuer declared to be authenticall till the Councell of Trent.

And when the Councel of Trent did approue it, it put no other truth into it then was there before, but onely declared it to be true. It followeth therefore, that the tranſlator was preſerued from error by no other meanes: and why might not the ſame direct ours alſo; as namely the infallible and perpetuall veritie of the doctrine it ſelfe tranſlated, the direction of Gods ſpirit, his owne diligence, meanes, skill, faithfulneſſe, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches carefull ouerſight?</p>
               <p n="4">4 The ſumme of all is this, that our Engliſh Bible contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1857:36"/> two things: the Doctrine, and the Tranſlation.<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim 3.16. 2.

The tranſlation was done by the miniſterie of the Church, and induſtrie of certaine men: who though they had no ſupernaturall inſpiration, or priuiledge from error, yet we know infallibly they haue not erred in the matter, by the ſame meanes whereby we know o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truths, and diſcerne other articles of Chriſtian faith: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the light of the doctrine tranſlated, the teſtimony of the ſpirit, the miniſtery of the word, the rules of art, the knowledge of the tongues, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="5">5 To that which the Ieſuite faith out of Gregory Martin, I anſwer, that Martin hath ſaid ſomething againſt our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but proued nothing.

               <p n="6">6 His next reaſon is, that the often change and variable tranſlations do ſhew that ſome haue erred. Whereto I anſwer two things, Firſt, though it be granted that ſome haue erred, yet hence it followeth not that all haue, which is the point he muſt proue: elſe he were as gond ſay nothing. For we defend the Scriptures well and faithfully tranſlated; not this or that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1857:37"/> mans edition, whereof our Church taketh no notice whether it be pure or no. It is ſufficient for the veritie of our aſſertion, that in the Church there be ſome tranſlations faithfull, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the originall.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Secondly, we do not deny but our tranſlations varie and haue bene altered, according to<note n="h" place="margin">Poſſeuin. bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioth. ſelect. l. 2. cap. 8. &amp; inde.

For we know the diuine doctrine to be one and the ſame in all tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations; immediatly in the originall, and more obſcurely in the tranſlations: and therefore we ſo vſe them, as that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all by the originall, approuing the beſt, and not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the mending of it, if need require. But this change implies no ſuch error in the matter. For one true ſence may be vttered diuerſly, and though things be alwayes one and the ſame, yet words be diuers. In which ſence our tranſlations are of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſort, and yet no materiall error. As for example, ſome playner, or in phraſe liker the original then otherſome. One tranſlation is in verſe, another in proſe: one word for word, another ſence for ſence: one hath a higher &amp; obſcurer phraſe, another a low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and playner: yet how can it be inferred hereupon, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be erronious, when they all yeeld the ſame diuine ſence?

Which light is of this nature, that it giueth teſtimonie to it ſelfe, and receiueth authoritie from no other, as the Sunne is not ſeene by any light but his owne, and we diſcerne ſweet from ſowre by it owne taſt. And for the opening of our eyes to ſee this light, whereby our conſcience may be aſſured, we haue diuers meanes: ſome priuate, as skill in the tongues, learning, labour, prayer, conference, &amp;c.

Therefore I anſwer, there be certaine helpes to enable vs to vnderſtand; the neceſſitie and requiſite condition wherof hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the plainneſſe and eaſineſſe of the rule, as I ſhewed when<note n="b" place="margin">§ 4. nu. 2.</note> I handled the properties thereof. For the word of God<note n="c" place="margin">2.

And will the Ieſuite himſelfe, becauſe a man neuer hearing of the Churches determination, abideth ſtill in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, giue me leaue to inferre hereupon, that therefore the Church is not the rule? and yet the reaſon is all one. Againe, there be certaine impediments, ſome naturall, as infancie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnedneſſe; ſome ſinfull, as ignorance, pride, frowardneſſe; which muſt be remoued afore we can heare the Scriptures, as they muſt alſo afore we can heare the Church; for which cauſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1857:39"/> the Lord hath giuen vs<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 10 14.

For the Law of our land is the rule of Societie, yet locke vp an vnlettered man and the Law booke for a time together in a ſtudy, and he wil come forth againe as ignorant in matters of law as he went in, if we admit no other meanes: but let the booke be opened and the text read, and then (as<note n="f" place="margin">Hom. 3. de Laz.</note> Chryſoſtome ſpeaketh) the moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned man that is, ſhall vnderſtand. The Carpenters ſquire is the rule to meaſure by, yet a child can do nothing with it. The Sunne is our comfortable light to ſee by, yet we muſt open our eyes, and apply the meanes. In all arts, as in the Mathematicks, Law, or Phyſicke, the precepts are the rule whereby the truth of euery queſtion may be tried; yet the bookes muſt be opened, and time muſt be ſpent in learning them. And though the Ieſuite do all he can to haue his Church the rule, yet he muſt needs grant the determination thereof is neither knowne nor agreed vpon without much labour: and when it ſpeaketh moſt plainly, yet infants, deafe men, and infidels heare it not.</p>

Moreouer there be many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the perfect vnderſtanding of the Scripture which are found but in verie few; and thoſe alſo wherein thoſe gifts are, be not alwayes infallibly ſure that they haue thoſe gifts and that they are ſo infallibly guided, but they and others may prudently doubt leſt ſometimes in their priuate expoſitions, as men, they erre, and conſequently their expoſitions cannot be that rule of faith which we ſeeke; which muſt be on the one fide, determinately and plainly vnderſtood and knowne, and on the other, infallible, certaine, and ſuch as cannot erre.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Now he proceedeth to ſhew how difficult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to learned men alſo, that ſo euery way he might diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it for being the rule of faith. His reaſon is, becauſe <hi>by onely reading they cannot be ſure they rightly vnderſtand it.</hi> Whereto I anſwer three things. Firſt, that we deny not the Scripture to be obſcure and difficult, or how the Ieſuite will, in two caſes. Firſt to all ſuch, learned or vnlearned, as are not diſpoſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1857:42"/> by the holy Ghoſt to vnderſtand them: but this kind of obſcurity may ſtand with the nature of the rule, as<note n="a" place="margin">§ 4 nu. 2.</note> I haue ſhewed; neither can the Ieſuite offer vs any ſo abſolutely knowne, no not his Church, but to theſe kind of men it ſhall be obſcure. Secondly, when the meanes which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the bringing vs to vnderſtanding, are not vſed. In this caſe the Scripture is obſcure I grant, but the fault is in our ſelues that neglect the meanes.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, though by onely reading we cannot be ſure we vnderſtand it, yet this obſcurity is not proued hereby: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are other meanes beſides onely reading, which concurring, the obſcuritie is done away, and all made plaine and eaſie, and we haue infallible aſſurance of the true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Theſe meanes are the miniſtery of the Church, and all kind of diligence, which the holy Ghoſt vſeth for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our vnderſtanding. And therefore that is not obſcure which by ordinary meanes may be apprehended, but that is ſo which either hath no meanes at all to open it, or onely hath ſuch as are not ordinarie. And two ſubalternall things be not contrary but ſubordinate, the facility of the text, and the means whereby that facility is induced.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, if by onely reading the Ieſuite meane onely the Scriptures themſelues, that a learned man cannot, vſing the meanes, find the true vnderſtanding out of the Scriptures on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: then he ſaith not true; for<note n="b" place="margin">Neh. 8.8. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>you muſt not from without them ſeeke a forren and ſtrange ſence, that ſo you may, as you can, confirme it with the authoritie of the text; but we muſt out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelues receiue the meaning of the truth.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Againſt this that I haue anſwered, the Ieſuite hath couched together diuers obiections. And firſt, that <hi>learned men many times miſtake the ſence of places, expounding that one way which is meant another, as for example that figuratiuely which is meant literally:</hi> whereto I anſwer three things. Firſt, this proueth not the pretended difficulty of the Scripture, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the weakneſſe and ignorance, or poſſible the frowardneſſe and preiudice of ſome men. And ſo a wrong cauſe is aſſigned; for the Scripture is not the cauſe of theſe mens erronious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as I will ſhew in the tenth Digreſſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Next this argument conuinceth not all the Scripture of obſcuritie, but only ſome of it: which we grant. But then what gaineth the Ieſuite? For he muſt proue that all the Scripture, and ſpecially that which containeth the principles of our faith, which we call the rule, to be obſcure and intricate: which he can neuer do. For<note n="k" place="margin">Aug. de doctr. Chriſt. li. 2. c. 9. Chryſ. hom. 3. in 2. Theſſ.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe things which concerne our faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, yea all things neceſſary, are plainely and manifeſtly ſet downe:</hi> the which cannot be made vncertaine by the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of other places. Therefore the diuerſitie of mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſheweth the learnedſt men that are<note n="l" place="margin">1. Cor. 13.11.</note> to know but in part, and the Scripture in ſome part to be obſcure; but not that all is obſcure, or that which is ſo, is too obſcure to be the rule. See Digreſſion 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Thirdly, though the proper interpretation be ſometime miſtaken, yet the truth is not alway thereby obſcured. For heare what<note n="m" place="margin">De doct. l. 2. cap. 36.</note> Auſtin ſaith: <hi>He erres not perniciouſly, neither doth he altogether ſay vntruly, who ſometime expoundeth otherwiſe then the text meaneth, if ſo his expoſition further charity, the end of the commandement. He is indeed deceiued, but yet ſo, as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1857:43"/> when a man loſing his way, through a by-field cometh whither the way leadeth.</hi> His meaning is, that in many caſes wrong expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hinder not the determinate and plaine iudgement of the text.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But ſeeing <hi>experience ſheweth that diuers expound diuerſly, yea one contrary to another, how may one be infallibly ſure that he only expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth right, hauing nothing to aſſure him but the ſeeming of his owne reaſon: which reaſon others thinke they haue as well as he.</hi> Wherto I anſwer three things. Firſt, this infallible certaintie befalleth not all men. For God in his iudgment leaueth many to be ſeduced by their own ſeeming ſenſe and reaſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in their owne opinions, as<note n="n" place="margin">Pſal 119.18. Ioh. 7.17. &amp; 8.43.47. &amp; 14 16.17. 1. Cor. 2.14. 2 Th 2.11. 2. Pet. 3.16.</note> the Scripture teacheth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly: neither is there any externall meanes left by God in the world, effectuall to conuince thoſe whom he hath giuen ouer, and which want his ſpirit, as already<note n="o" place="margin">§. 4. nu. 2.</note> I haue ſhewed. For though <hi>the Spirit ſpeake euidently in the text, and plentifully, to meet with all doubts and caſes,</hi> as<note n="p" place="margin">Part. 3. Tit. 18. c. 3. §. 3.</note> Antoninus ſpeaketh, yet the wicked haue no eares to heare it: their owne preiudice hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them. For what can be playner then this, that Ieſus is the Meſſias, the ſacrifice of Aaron is ceaſed, the blood of Chriſt doth away our ſins? yet the Iew beleeueth it not, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is giuen by Saint Paul,<note n="q" place="margin">2.

For<note n="ſ" place="margin">Princip. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin. fid. lib. 8. c. 1. &amp; 2. Triplic. inchoat. in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monit. ad Guil.

               <p n="8">8 Secondly, to the point of his demand, the truth contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture is a light, and is diſcerned by the ſonnes of light:<note n="u" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.20. Ioh. 8.31.32.</note> the inward witneſſe to aſſure them, is the annointing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1857:43"/> of the holy Ghoſt,<note n="x" place="margin">Luc. 1.4. Act. 17.11. 2. Pet. 1.19.</note> the outward witneſſe is the Scripture it ſelf, which by it own light perſwadeth vs, &amp; in all caſes, doubts queſtions, and controuerſies clearly teſtifieth with vs, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Which light is ordinarily attained to by vſing the meanes, ſome priuate, as reading, prayer, conference of places, conſent of the godly, helps of learning and reaſon ſanctified: ſome publick, as the miniſtery of the Church; which miniſtery, as all other meanes, is founded on the authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe. And this is ſomething to aſſure vs more then the ſeeming of our owne ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Thirdly, the Churches word and authoritie, neither doth, nor can aſſure vs: that is to ſay, we are not infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, this or that is the right meaning of the text, becauſe the Church hath decreed it ſo to be; but by the Churches miniſtery ordinarily we are inſtructed: as I ſhew more at large in the 11. Digreſſion, and haue touched already in the ſixth.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But <hi>many things are required for the perfect vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture, which are but in few: &amp; they which haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not ſure either that they haue them, or that they erre not in vſing them. Therefore the Scripture is too obſcure to be the rule:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I anſwer three things, according to the three parts of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Firſt, I grant certaine things are required as neceſſary conditions to the vnderſtanding of the Scriptures, but thoſe things are alway preſent in the Church, and the children of God partake them. The ſpirit of God is neceſſary,<note n="y" place="margin">Ioh. 3.8.</note> which breatheth where it liſteth: and the ordinary meanes of learning and diligence be neceſſary; but proueth not the obſcurity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For the Mathematicks be the rule of meaſures, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and numbers, and yet many things are required to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them. And the Ieſuite thinketh his Church is the rule, yet<note n="z" place="margin">Relect. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro. 1. qu. 3. pa. 30.</note> Stapleton writeth, that <hi>ſometime it is not ſeene ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but onely by ſuch as are very circumſpect and skilfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 Secondly, though more gifts of learning and art be needfull to ſuch as teach others yet that is rather to ſearch out and vtter the ſence, which the Scripture it ſelfe yeeldeth, then to bring any to it which was not there afore. And is not the touchſtone it whereby we trie gold, though ſome labour be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1857:44"/> needfull to find it out? And yet they want no gifts for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the text, that haue and vſe the text it ſelfe, in that all expoſition is to be ſetched out of it; which inuincibly proueth it to be the rule: and I haue often ſhewed that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the rule be, yet of neceſſitie there muſt be certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions obſerued for the vſing it, and this neceſſitie argueth it not of obſcuritie.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Laſtly I ſay, they which haue the meanes to vnderſtand the Scripture, know infallibly, both that they haue them, and that they vſe them right: in the ſame manner that<note n="a" place="margin">Ariſt. de ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. l. 3. c 2.</note> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher proueth, that <hi>with the ſame ſenſe we ſee, and are aſſured we ſee.</hi> For ſuppoſing I haue the meanes that bringeth vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it were a moſt abſurd thing to imagine thoſe very meanes could not aſſure my conſcience of the function or vſe of them.</p>

For who is able to behold the Sunne in his brightneſſe, but his eyes will dazle? yet that is the chiefe light whereby we ſee it ſelfe and all things elſe.

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p n="1">1 The Ieſuits firſt exception againſt the Scripture was, that it was too difficult: now followeth his next, that it containeth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1857:47"/> not all things needfull to be knowne. Thus his argument may be concluded:
<q>
                     <p>The rule muſt be vniuerſall, containing all points of faith.</p>
                     <p>But ſuch is not the Scripture: for many ſubſtantiall points are not expreſly ſet downe therein.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is not the rule.</p>
                  </q> Whereto I anſwer, denying the aſſumption: for euery point of faith, and whatſoeuer elſe is needfull either to be knowne or done, is contained in the ſcripture, ſo far forth that there is no point, queſtion or doubt concerning faith, but by the ſcriptures alone it may abſolutely be determined. For<note n="a" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15.</note> 
                  <hi>it is profitable to teach, to reproue, to correct, and to instruct in all righteouſneſſe, that the child of God may be abſolute, being made perfect to all good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 But the Ieſuite ſaith, <hi>there be diuers things not expreſly ſet downe or determined:</hi> reſeruing this word <hi>expreſly,</hi> for a ſtarting hole to creepe out at, becauſe they be not written word for word in ſo many ſyllables. But I anſwer him three things: firſt that the Popiſh diuinitie is, that many points are contained in the Scripture, neither thus expreſly, nor yet at all to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thence by collection: for elſe why make they that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition betweene the ſcripture and tradition? Secondly, if this be his mind, then he hath put more into the aſſumption then was in the propoſition: for the rule is not bound to containe all things thus expreſly. Thirdly, that is expreſly in the ſcripture which is there ſet downe, either plainly in ſo many words, as<note n="b" place="margin">De doctrin. Chriſtian. l. 2. c. 9.</note> Auſtine ſaith, <hi>All things are that concerne our faith and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: or by analogie when it is neceſſarily</hi> implied in the text. For<note n="c" place="margin">Alliaco 1. ſen. qu. 1. art. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>euery ſuch concluſion is a theologicall diſcourſe,</hi> and hath his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the text: and ſo ſtill the ſcripture containeth all things needfull.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Againſt this the Ieſuit hath one argument, that it is no where written, that theſe bookes of ſcripture that we haue, are the true word of God. Wherto I anſwer: firſt though this were granted, yet would it not follow that all points of faith are not contained in the ſcripture; becauſe in euery profeſſion, the principles are indemonſtrable, aſſented to without diſcourſe:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1857:47"/> and the ſcriptures are the principles of religion, and therefore firſt we muſt grant them to be the very word of God, and then ſay, they are ſuch as containe all points needfull to be knowne. This then which the Ieſuite requireth to be ſhewed out of the text it ſelfe, is firſt to be ſuppoſed, yea beleeued, that it is the true word of God, whereto we are perſwaded by the heauenly light it ſelfe. Secondly, I wonder at the Ieſuites confidence, that dareth ſo boldly ſay, that of euery booke holden for ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we find it not expreſly written that they are the true word of God: for Saint Paul<note n="d" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note> ſaith expreſly, <hi>All Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God:</hi> and Saint Peter<note n="e" place="margin">2. Pet 1.20. Luc. 1.70.</note> ſaith, <hi>No prophecie in the Scripture is of priuate interpretation, but the holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now to be inſpired of God, and to be the true word of God, is all one. The former is written, we ſee, expreſly of all Scripture, therefore of euery booke, and therefore the latter is alſo written.</p>
               <p n="4">4 If the Ieſuite reply, but where is it written that theſe bookes which we haue, be the ſame of whom it is ſaid, they are inſpired of God? or, how know you the Scripture, that tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth you ſo, is the word of God? I anſwer, this is nothing to the purpoſe: for he deſireth onely to know where it is written, that theſe bookes be the word of God, and I anſwer him by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the places out of the bookes themſelues.</p>

               <p n="1">1 This is the Ieſuites third argument againſt the ſcriptures: and it is thus framed:
<q>
                     <p>That which doth not inſtruct ſuch as find it and obey it, in all points of faith, and preſerue them from error, is not the rule.</p>
                     <p>But the Scripture doth not inſtruct ſuch as find it and obey it, in all points of faith, and preſerue them from error: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in that many thus vſing it, do notwithſtanding erre.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the Scripture alone is not the rule.</p>
                  </q> For anſwer to this argument, you muſt not forget in what ſence<note n="a" place="margin">§ 4 nu. 2.</note> I haue ſhewed the Scriptures <hi>alone</hi> to be the rule. For when we ſay <hi>alone,</hi> we exclude not the ſubordinate meanes and diſpoſitions, whereby we are enabled to vſe them; but the authoritie of all other things, either to ſupply their ſuppoſed imperfection, or to giue the ſence: and therefore granting the propoſition, I denie the minor with the confirmation thereof being meerly falſe. For all ſuch as finding the ſcripture, do obey and yeeld aſſent vnto it, are thereby ſufficiently preſerued from error, and inſtructed in the truth. And the reaſon why ſome v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it (as the Ieſuite and his Church, for example) do notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding erre, is becauſe either they vnderſtand it not, or will yeeld no aſſent vnto it. For there is no cauſe ſo abſolute, but the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1857:50"/> effect thereof may, from without, be hindered, when a ſtoppe commeth betweene. See Digreſſion 10. where all this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is anſwered.</p>
               <p n="2">2 So that when men vſing the Scriptures do notwithſtanding remaine in error, the let is in themſelues. For though poſſible <hi>they confeſſe them to be Gods word,</hi> yet all obedience to them conſiſteth not in that: but it is further required that the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their heart be done away, and that curioſity, preiudice, &amp; other impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be remoued: as we may ſee by this, that there is nothing more clearly defined by the Church, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is but one God, and three perſons which made all things, that Chriſt is the ſonne of God, borne of the virgin Marie: yet theſe th ngs we ſee are in controuerſie among them that vſe the Scriptures. So then it muſt not be granted the Ieſuite that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, or any, that groſly erreth in matters of faith, yeeldeth obedience to the Scripture in all that it teacheth; for if they did ſo, they could not erre.</p>

There was neuer any Papiſt in the world that durſt alledge this text for the authoritie of the Church: and yet granting the Ieſuites expoſition, it ſhould proue it inuincibly. 5.

                  </gap>e that for matters of faith, rely either vpon their owne interpretation of Scripture, or vpon the interpretation of other learned not aſſiſted infallibly by the holy Ghoſt, cannot haue an infallible faith. This I proue. Becauſe all this wit and learning is humane, naturall, and fallible, and therefore cannot be a rule or foundation whereupon to build a diuine, ſupernaturall, and infallible faith. The third concluſion: that no priuate man, who perſwadeth him ſelfe to be eſpecially inſtructed by the Spirit, can be this infallible rule of faith; at leaſt ſo farre forth as he teacheth or beleeueth contrarie to the receiued doctrine of the catholike Church; this I proue, firſt becauſe <hi>S. Paul Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>ſaith, Si quis vobis euangelizauerit praeter id quod accepiſtis, anathema ſit.</hi> Pronouncing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that whoſoeuer teacheth contrarie to the receiued doctrine of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, ſhould be held anathematized or accurſed. Secondly I proue the ſame, becauſe the rule of faith muſt be infallible, plainly knowne, and vniuerſall, as before hath bene proued. But this priuate ſpirit is not ſuch. For neither the partie himſelfe, and much leſſe any other, can be infallibly ſure, that he in particular is taught by the holy Ghoſt. For neither is there anie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in Scripture to aſſure that he in particular is thus taught by the holy Ghoſt; neither is his particular perſwaſion, be it neuer ſo ſeeming ſtrong, able
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1857:53"/> to giue infallible aſſurance thereof, ſince diuerſe now adayes perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be thus taught by the Spirit, and yet one of them teaching contrary to another: and therefore ſome, in theſe their perſwaſions muſt needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. And therefore who, without teſtimonie of true miracle, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallible proofe, dare arrogantly affirme, that he onely is not deceiued, ſince others that perſwade themſelues in the ſame maner that he doth, are in this their perſwaſion ſometime deceiued? Moreouer, ſuppoſe one aſſure himſelfe to be taught by Gods Spirit immediatly in all things what is the true faith, as it is not the maner of Almightie God to teach men immediatly by himſelfe, but rather as the Scripture telleth vs, <hi>Fides ex auditu, Rom.</hi> 10. and it is to be required <hi>ex ore ſacerdotis,</hi> and muſt be learned of <hi>Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, whom God hath put in his Church, vt non circumferamur omni vento doctrinae.</hi> But ſuppoſe, I ſay, one in priuate thinke himſelfe to be immediatly taught of God, how ſhould he, without teſtimonie of miracle, giue aſſurance to others that he is thus taught? eſpecially in ſuch ſort to make them forſake the teaching of the catholike Church, which by plaine proofes and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture they do know to be taught of God?

For in matters of religion it maketh no matter whether the teachers be many or few, publicke or priuate perſons, as long as they teach the faith, and expound the Scriptures truly. For a true expoſition is publicke, though the companie that giue it be priuate; and a falſe expoſition is priuate, though the Church that vrge it be neuer ſo publick, yea though it came from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell. And ſo this is to be holden concerning <hi>priuate men and companies,</hi> that they may ſometime be infallibly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the truth againſt a publicke multitude, as the Romane Church for example; and hauing the Scripture for their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, may teach and beleeue againſt it: in which caſe, though their <hi>perſons, and wit, and naturall learning, be not the rule,</hi> yet as long as they follow the Scripture, which is the rule, we are bound to heare them. This being all that we hold, and that which the Ieſuite in theſe concluſions girdeth at, now I come to examine his arguments againſt it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Firſt he ſaith, <hi>all mens wit and learning is humane, natural, and fallible: therfore no mans wit or learning can be the rule which muſt ſuſtaine our faith, diuine, ſupernaturall and infallible.</hi> Wherto I anſwer, granting the whole argument: for we ſay not, any mans learning is the rule, or any companie of men the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our faith, but the contrary, as I haue ſaid: onely we hold they may be ſo aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, that they may interprete the Scriptures truly and infallibly againſt a company as big as the Romane Church. And this is a full anſwer to the ſecond concluſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Next, in his third concluſion he ſaith, <hi>No priuate man can be this rule, at leaſt when he teacheth contrary to the receiued
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1857:54"/> doctrine of the Catholicke Church: becauſe Saint Paul ſaith, If any preach any other Goſpell then then which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> This text is<note n="b" place="margin">Rhem. vpon Gal. <hi>1.8.</hi>
                  </note> commonly vrged againſt Luther and Caluin, for preaching otherwiſe then the Romiſh Church beleeueth; whereby you may ſee what the Ieſuite dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth at in theſe two concluſions. But I anſwer, though this text proue that no priuate man is the rule of faith, and that no tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching may be receiued againſt the Scriptures; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it againſt ſuch as reſiſt a falſe Church, though they be men neuer ſo priuate. For Saint Paul ſpeaketh of the doctrine which he had taught, not which euery Church, calling it ſelfe Catholicke, may poſſible hold; and of it he ſaith, <hi>Let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed that preacheth otherwiſe.</hi> Now<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 3.1. Iren. l. 3. ca. 1. Niceph. Calliſt. l. 2. c. 34.</note> all that the Apoſtle prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, is written in the Scriptures, and ſo he accurſeth none but ſuch as teach againſt them: forbidding all men to preach againſt the Churches doctrine conſenting with the word. But when any thing deflecteth from that, it may and muſt be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, euen by priuate men, elſe this very text accurſeth them for conſenting to it. Thus<note n="d" place="margin">Contra lit. Petilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p n="4">4 His ſecond argument to proue his third concluſion is, that <hi>the priuate ſpirit is not infallible and plainly knowne.</hi> Whereto I anſwer, that this is falſe, meaning priuate as the Ieſuite doth, &amp; I haue diſtinguiſhed it: for a ſmal company holding againſt a multitude, as<note n="e" place="margin">1.

But <hi>neither the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues nor any other can be ſure they are thus taught.</hi> I anſwer, this is vntrue: for the Scripture is a light, and knowne by the ſons of light, and by it they may be

                  <hi>All Scripture is inſpired of God,</hi> and containeth the teaching of the holy Ghoſt.

And firſt that the doctrine of the vniuerſall Church in all points is infallible, thus I reaſon: If our Sauiour Chriſt haue <hi>promiſed</hi> to any company of men the aſſiſtance of himſelfe and of his holy Spirit for this ſpeciall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to teach and inſtruct them in euery truth, <hi>giuing</hi> withall peculiar <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to them to teach all nations, and <hi>warrant</hi> and <hi>commandement</hi> to all to heare them, and to do in all things according to their ſaying: and further, <hi>threatning</hi> that he that will not heare them, and do in all things according to their ſaying ſhould be accounted as an Ethnicke and Publican then certainly the doctrine and the teaching of this companie of men is in all points infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt true. For looke what he <hi>promiſeth</hi> muſt needs be performed, and whatſoeuer he <hi>warranteth</hi> or <hi>commandeth</hi> to be done, may ſafely and without danger of error be done; nay muſt of neceſſitie be done, eſpecially when he threateneth thoſe that will not do it; and conſequently if he promiſe to ſend his holy Spirit to teach anie companie of men all truth, it is not to be doubted but that he ſendeth this his Spirit, and by him teacheth them all truth. And ſince the teaching of this Spirit is infallible; we haue not to doubt but that this companie to which this <hi>promiſe</hi> ſhould be made, ſhould in all points be infallibly taught the truth. If alſo the ſame our Sauior gaue <hi>warrant</hi> and <hi>commandement</hi> that we ſhould heare and do in all points according to the ſaying of this companie of men, being thus infallibly taught, and hauing <hi>commiſſion</hi> to teach, we may not likewiſe doubt but that they ſhall infallibly teach vs the truth in all points. For otherwiſe, by this his commandement, we ſhould ſometimes be bound to heare and beleeue that which were not true, and to do that which were not right and good; which without blaſphemie to Chriſts veritie and goodneſſe can no way be taught. But ſo it is that Chriſt our Sauiour hath in holy Scripture promiſed, giuen commiſſion, warranted, commanded, and threatened in maner aforeſaid: therefore we haue not to doubt, but that a certaine companie of men there be, to wit, that companie which is called the true catholike Church, which both is in all points taught infallibly by the holy Spirit, and is in like maner to teach vs all truth. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

In which words is promiſed the continuall preſence of Chriſt himſelfe, the maiſter of truth, with his holy Church: not for a while then, nor for a while now, but all the dayes vnto the end of the world. Alſo we haue another promiſe <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14. <hi>Ego rogabo Patrem meum, &amp; alium paracletum dabit vobis, Spiritum veritatis, vt maneat vobiſcum in aeternum:</hi> I will aske my Father, and he will giue you another paraclete, that he may remaine with you not onely for ſixe hundred yeares, but for euer. And to ſhew vs for what purpoſe he would haue his holy Spirit to remaine with vs for euer, he ſaith againe, <hi>Cum autem venerit ille Spiritus veritatis, docebit vos omnem veritatem, Iob.</hi> 16. And when the Spirit of truth ſhall come, he ſhall teach you all truth. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion we haue <hi>Mat. vltim.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable or good. For though in this place our Sauiour do onely ſpeake of the chaire of Moſes in which the prieſts of the old law did ſit, yet it muſt be vnderſtood <hi>à fortiori</hi> of the chaire of S. Peter, in which the Prieſts of the new law do ſucceed. So did the ancient Fathers vnderſtand, and eſpecially <hi>S Auſtin Epiſt.</hi> 165. who ſaith thus: <hi>In illum ordinem Epiſcoporum qui ducitur ab ipſo Petro ad Anaſtaſium qui nunc in eadem cathedra ſedet, etiamſi quiſquam tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor per illa tempora ſubrepſiſſet, nihil praeiudicaret Eccleſiae &amp; innocentibus Chriſtianis, quibus Dominus prouidens ait, de praepoſitis malis, quae dicunt facite, quae faciunt facere nolite.</hi> Into the order of Biſhops which is deriued from S. Peter himſelf vnto Anaſtaſius who now ſitteth vpon the ſame chaire, although ſome traitor had crept in for the time, he ſhould nothing hurt or preiudice the Church of the innocent Chriſtians, vnto whom our Lord prouiding ſaith of euill Prelates, what they ſay, do; what they do, do not. The threats we may gather out of <hi>Luc.</hi> 10. where our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Qui vos ſpernit me ſpernit,</hi> He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me: ſignifying what ſinne it were not to heare, but to deſpiſe the preaching of our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe; that we ſhould account it the ſame ſinne, to deſpiſe and not to giue heed and credite to his catholike Church: inſinuating thereby a threat of like puniſhment for the ſaid contempt. Alſo <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. the ſame our Sauiour ſaith, <hi>Si Eccleſiam non au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierit, ſit tibi ſicut Ethnicus &amp; Publicanus.</hi> Thus you ſee our Sauiour Chriſt hath promiſed vnto his Church the continuall aſſiſtance of himſelfe and of his holy Spirit to teach vs all truth. Moreouer that he hath giuen commiſſion to it to teach vs; yea and hath warranted and commanded vs, in all points, to heare and to do according to the ſaying of his Church; and hath threatened greatly thoſe that will not heare the Church: which proueth, that it pertaineth
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1857:59"/> to this Church to inſtruct vs in all points of faith; &amp; that we ought to learne of it, in all matters of religion, the infallible truth.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The drift of all this ſection is to proue, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the vniuerſal Church, in all things, is infallible: which if it were granted, yet were it too ſhort to proue, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Church were the rule of faith. For euery infallible thing, whoſe teaching is moſt true, is not yet in the ordinance of God ſet apart to inſtruct vs. As the Angels of heauen, for example, are not the rule of our faith, though<note n="a" place="margin">Fr.

And the Ieſuite of neceſſitie, by the vniuerſall Church muſt vnderſtand onely this part thereof, becauſe this part onely is apt to teach vs, and hath miniſterie in her hands: or elſe he diſputeth confuſedly, not diſtinguiſhing the termes of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1857:60"/>3 This being noted, now I come to the diſcourſe: which may all be concluded in this ſyllogiſme, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter iudge of it.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That <hi>1.</hi> vnto which Chriſt hath promiſed his owne preſence, and the preſence of his ſpirit, for euer to the worlds end: <hi>2.</hi> which hath commiſſion from God to teach all nations: <hi>3.</hi> which all men are commaunded to heare in all things: <hi>4.</hi> they that heare it are warranted as if they heard Christ himſelfe. <hi>5.</hi> they that heare it not, are threatned as if they despiſed Chriſt himſelfe: that is free from error, and the doctrine thereof, in all things, is infallible.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is the Church, that concerning it Chriſt hath <hi>1.</hi> promiſed, <hi>2.</hi> giuen commiſſion, <hi>3.</hi> commanded, <hi>4.</hi> warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>5.</hi> threatned, as is aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Church is free from error, and the doctrine thereof, in all things, is infallible.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the ſumme of all this ſection: whereto I anſwer by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying both propoſitions; and the reaſon is for that they conſiſt of Scripture falſly expounded and applyed: and this my anſwer I ſet downe more particularly in that which followeth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will examine euery text as it is alledged, and make it plain, that neuer a one of them proueth the concluſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The firſt place is <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo I am with you alway to the worlds end.</hi> But I anſwer: 1. this was a perſonall promiſe made onely to the Apoſtles, and ſo cannot be extended to all the Church, if we will ſpeake of the words properly, according to their immediate ſence. 2. To whomſoeuer it belongeth, the meaning is,<note n="c" place="margin">Ianſen. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This muſt needes be granted to be all that is meant. Firſt, becauſe Chriſt is not abſent from his people euery time they fall into an error, but remaineth with them ſtill for all that, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing it, or reforming it. Secondly, this promiſe notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet afterward,<note n="d" place="margin">Gal 2.11. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Auguſt. de Baptiſm cont. Donat. l. 2. c. 1. &amp; de agon. Chriſtian. c. 30. Thom. in ep. ad Gal. c. 3. lect. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> one to whom the promiſe was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1857:60"/> made, <hi>erred againſt the truth of the Goſpell,</hi> and was therefore by Paul rebuked, and reſiſted to his face: which thing could not haue fallen out, if this promiſe had exempted the Church from all error. Thirdly, if it priuiledge the whole Church from error becauſe it is made to it, then conſequently it priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the particular Churches, Paſtors, and beleeuers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe it is made to them likewiſe: but experience ſheweth theſe latter may erre: and therefore the meaning muſt needs be as I haue ſaid. Fourthly,<note n="e" place="margin">See. §.</note> it is a ruled caſe among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that <hi>the Pope may erre;</hi> which could not be if theſe words of Chriſt meant the Church of Rome, and that infallible iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the Ieſuite talketh of. As for his gloſſe vpon the words that <hi>Chriſt in them ſhould promiſe his continuall preſence, not for a while then, nor for a while now, but for euer,</hi> it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther either idle and inept. For he can name no Proteſtant that euer thought Chriſt was at any time abſent, but we all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beleeue he alway was, is, and ſhall be with his Church to the end.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The ſecond and third places are much like the firſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and he ſhall giue you another comforter, that he may abide with you for euer. And Iohn</hi> 16.13. <hi>When he is come which is the Spirit of truth, he will leade you into all truth.</hi> But I anſwer two things. Firſt theſe words are properly extended to the Apoſtles, promiſing<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 2.4.</note> that which was performed immediatly after Chriſts aſcention, and ought not to be ſtretched any further. Which being ſo, they conclude ſomewhat for them, but little for the Church: becauſe euerie grace belongeth not to the Church in all ages that was giuen the Apoſtles. Secondly, applying them to the Church alſo, the meaning is, that the holy Ghoſt ſhould neuer forſake it, but perſeuere in teaching it all truh, which is ſimply neceſſary to ſaue it, according as the Church is able to learne it, which he doth by meanes of the Scripture: though not at all times alike perfectly, but ſo as he endueth it with all holines, and yet many ſins are found in it. This interpretation muſt needs be allowed for three cauſes, firſt, the Apoſtle ſaith, of himſelfe and the Church,<note n="g" place="margin">1. Cor. 13.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Now we know but in part, and propheſie in part.</hi> Which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1857:61"/> were not true, if theſe words of Chriſt had ſecured the Church in all things and in euery truth: for the part cometh ſhort of the whole. Secondly, this promiſe belongeth as well to one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle as another, yea<note n="h" place="margin">1. Ioh 2.20.</note> to all the faithfull as wel as to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, if it reach to the Church: ſo that if that be the ſence which the Ieſuite ſetteth downe, then all the Apoſtles had equall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges from error with Peter, and particular Churches and men ſhould be as infallible as the whole Church it ſelfe, which I am ſure the Ieſuite will not grant. Thirdly, Saint Auſtine<note n="i" place="margin">Tract. 96. in Ioh. tom. 9.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the words as I do: <hi>He ſhall teach or leade you into all truth:] this I think cannot be fulfilled in any mans mind in this life: for who is he liuing in this bodie ſo corrupt, and loading the ſoule, that can know all truth, when the Apoſtle ſaith, we know but in part? But foraſmuch as by the holy Ghoſt it cometh to paſſe, whoſe earneſt we haue receiued, that hereafter we may come to the fulneſſe it ſelf, whereof the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, then ſhall we ſee him face to face; and now I know but in part, but then I ſhall know as I am knowne, not that which ſhall be in this l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>fe onely, but all that which ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs till the perfection come: the Lord by the loue of his ſpirit hath promiſed, ſaying, He ſhall teach you all truth.</hi> As for the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites expoſition, that he may remaine with you <hi>for euer, not onely for ſixe hundred yeares,</hi> it ſmelleth either of his malice, or ignorance. For which of vs euer yet ſaid, the holy Ghoſt depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church after ſixe hundred yeares? Let the Papiſts deale ſincerely, and leaue their coyning.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The fourth place is <hi>Math.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all nations.</hi> Whereto I anſwer, firſt, theſe words were ſpoken to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles onely, and not to that which the Ieſuite calleth the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church. Now I grant their teaching was infallible, and all men were bound to heare it; for they taught that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they writ in the Scripture: yet ſo they taught, and with ſuch commiſſion, that<note n="k" place="margin">Act 17.11.</note> the people are commended which exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined their teaching by the Scriptures. Secondly, we grant the Paſtors of the Church in all ages haue commiſſion to teach likewiſe, but that proueth not all their teaching to be alway infallible, becauſe naturall corruption hanging on them, they may faile in that which is committed to them. Neither is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1857:61"/> this any inconuenience, <hi>binding vs ſometime to beleeue that which is falſe:</hi> for the bond hath a limitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we heare them ſo farre as they teach agreeable with the ſcriptures, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and by thoſe ſcriptures we may relieue our ſelues if they chance to teach falſly.</p>

But being applied to the Church and ordinary Paſtors therein,<note n="l" place="margin">Ferus lib. 3 in Math. cap. 23.</note> they muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with this caution, if they hold them to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that Chriſt giueth them, if they come in the name of Chriſt, deliuering his words truly and conſonant to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for ſuch are to be heard as Chriſt himſelfe: elſe<note n="m" place="margin">1.

Secondly he affirmeth, that in all this Romane ſucceſſion there had bene neuer a Donatiſt: and though there had, yet ſhould the people of God incurre no danger thereby, becauſe Chriſt hath forewarned them of euill ouerſeers, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their teaching and not their doing. In all which diſcourſe what one word is there, whereby it may be gathered that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine thought as the Ieſuite doth, that in all points we muſt do according to the doctrine of the Prelates, or that the Church and Biſhops of Rome can erre in nothing? for the ſucceſſion mentioned, implieth no ſuch matter, for any thing that Auſtine ſaith. And the other words, Our Lord hath prouided for his Church, by ſaying of euill Prelates, Do what they ſay, but not what they do; can ſhew no other meaning in him then was in Chriſt: and how Chriſt meant them, I haue alreadie ſet downe; the ſumme whereof is, that no Chriſtian man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the vnitie of the Church for the Paſtors euill life, but that ſtill they heare them and follow them, as long as they teach out of the chaire, that is, according to the doctrine of Moſes and Peter, from which the Romiſh Church is departed long ago. So that thoſe words, Do what they teach, being referred to the former, they ſit in Moſes chaire, muſt be expounded ioyntly with them, Do what they teach out of the chaire; which being granted, how followeth it from hence, that therefore the teachers can erre in nothing?</p>

For ſo the true faith, written in the tables of the Scripture, whereunto the world will giue no teſtimonie, is faſtened to the Church, as to a ſtately pillar and ſtrong ſupporter, that there it may be ſeene, and holden out vnto vs. Hence the Ieſuite can challenge no more but that the Church is vnto vs a witneſſe and vpholder of the faith, and alway preſerueth it; which we denie not; but in the meane time he forgetteth, that it is one thing to hold out the rule, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the rule it ſelfe: and he that ſaith the Church is the ſupporter of truth, doth not ſay withall that the Paſtors can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer erre or faile in deliuering any part thereof.

Reg. 6 16.</note> the king of Arams ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſaw not <hi>the mountaine full of horſes and chariots of fire</hi> that were round about Eliſha, nor knew that they were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of Samaria till their eyes were opened; or poſſible with the miſt of their owne errors, or ſmoke of perſecution they may obſcure it: according to that of the Reuelation,<note n="f" place="margin">Apoc. 9.1.</note> where it is ſhewed, that <hi>a ſtarre falling from heauen, the bottomleſſe pit was opened, and there aroſe out of it a ſmoke, wherewith the Sunne and the aire was darkened.</hi> So Saint Auſtine<note n="g" place="margin">Ep. 80. ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſych. prope fin. &amp; epiſt. 48. ad Vincent.</note> ſpeaketh, <hi>When the Sunne ſhall he darkened, and the Moone ſhal not giue her light, and the ſtarres ſhall fall from heauen, then the Church ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by reaſon vngodly perſecutors ſhall rage out of meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 So then where the Church is called a light, the meaning is not that it is <hi>alway viſible,</hi> or that the externall appearance thereof is plaine to euery eye, and at all times; for thus the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts grant their owne Church is not viſible: but that as the Sunne, ſo it hath in it ſelfe all light of truth and glorie, whereby the children of God are enlightned, and the darke wayes of the vngodly detected: and except hereſies or perſecutions come betweene, this inward light doth alſo ſhew it ſelfe forth to the world by outward profeſſion and gouernment, ſo as no tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtate is more glorious or conſpicuous. Which difference betweene the inward and outward light, being rightly expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and obſerued, the Ieſuite may find <hi>how it may be the light of the world, though ſometime</hi> by eclipſe <hi>it become inuiſible:</hi> for at all times, and to all men, and of it owne nature, it is not ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Next, the other propoſition faileth likewiſe: for though the light of the Church be graunted, yet it is not true that <hi>Chriſt our Sauiour ordained it to be alwayes the light of the world, according to theſe words, Math.</hi> 5. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>os eſtis lux mundi, You are the light of the world:</hi> for thoſe words were ſpoken by Chriſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1857:70"/> to his diſciples; and his purpoſe therein was not to teach what the ſtate of the Church ſhould alway be, but to prouoke them to conſtancie and holineſſe, forſomuch as they ſhould be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans eye, and therefore if they chanced to do otherwiſe then well, it could be concealed no more then the light of the Sunne. Now this is nothing to the Churches viſibleneſſe. For the Apoſtles being ſet ouer all the world, to enlighten it with their teaching as it were Sunne, might be in the view thereof, and yet the Church afterward, with the Paſtors therein, be ſuppreſſed from the ſight of her enemies. This therefore is a common error of the Papiſts, that whatſoeuer things in the Scriptures are perſonally affirmed of ſome particular times and perſons, they will ſtretch generally to all.</p>
               <p n="4">4 His ſecond argument to proue the Church alway vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is, <hi>becauſe Chriſt ordained it to be a rule or meanes, by which men may come to knowledge of the faith:</hi> wherein he beggeth the queſtion, or as<note n="h" place="margin">Rat. 9.</note> Campian the Ieſuite telleth vs,<note n="i" place="margin">Eccum quos gyros, quas ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas fabricat.</note> 
                  <hi>Turneth the wheele.</hi> For being to proue that the Church is the rule of faith,<note n="k" place="margin">§ 16.</note> he ſaid he would do it, <hi>by ſhewing the teaching thereof to be infallibly eaſie and vniuerſall;</hi> and this he would do by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it to be <hi>alway viſible:</hi> and now he ſaith it is viſible, <hi>becauſe it is the rule or meanes whereby to finde the truth:</hi> which is the queſtion, and would not haue bin aſſumed, but proued. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe his reaſon ſhal be examined and conſidered of: for thus it ſtandeth:
<q>
                     <p>That which Chriſt appointed to be the rule whereby all men at all times may come to the true faith, muſt be alway viſible to all ſorts of men.</p>
                     <p>But Chriſt appointed the Church to be the rule whereby all men at all times may come to the true faith.</p>
                     <p>Ergo the Church muſt be alway viſible to all ſorts of men.</p>
                  </q> This argument is faultie two wayes: firſt in the aſſumption: for the Church is not this rule, as<note n="l" place="margin">Digr. 3. &amp; § 14 per totum.</note> I haue ſhewed at large: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Ieſuite <hi>alreadie proued it,</hi> but onely ſaid it, as here he beggeth it to proue that which before he brought to proue this.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But yet it is a ſubordinate meanes for the bringing men

               <p n="1">1 The Church, according to the texts alledged, neither faileth to profeſſe outwardly the faith which in heart it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, nor yet is made viſible and knowne to all by this profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The reaſon is, becauſe the children of the Church profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among themſelues, when perſecution will not ſuffer them to do it openly, this is outward profeſſion, and ſatisfieth the Scripture alledged: which requireth no more at our hand, but firſt that we profeſſe openly to the world, as long as the ſame will ſuffer vs, and be readie to ſeale the faith thus profeſſed with our bloud, when by neceſſary circumſtance of time and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1857:72"/> place, we ſhall be called thereunto. Secondly, that when perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or any other impediment hindereth vs from this, yet we profeſſe one to another, and maintaine the faith, whereſoeuer or how few ſoeuer we be together. Which latter degree of confeſſing, of the beleeuers among themſelues, firſt is outward, in that it is a ſenſible exerciſe of that which the heart beleeueth, and ſo many as liue together know one another thereby. Next the Scripture requireth no more; for our Sauiour<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> biddeth, <hi>when they perſecute vs in one citie, flie to another,</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">Apoc. 12.6.14</note> promiſeth <hi>to prepare a place in the wilderneſſe, where he will feed the woman,</hi> which ſignifieth the Church, and keepe her from the preſence of the Serpent: which cannot be but by leauing the open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion which all men ſee, and flying to that which is priuately outward among themſelues. And laſtly it is not ſufficient to make the Church viſible to all: for there was a Church in Iſrael of <hi>ſeuen thouſand that neuer bowed the knee to Baal</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1. Reg. 19.10.18. Rom. 10.3.</note>, yet were they not made knowne by this profeſſion. And<note n="d" place="margin">1.

But as the Sunne which neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to yeeld forth light, but alwayes ſhineth aboue, though ſome thing coming betweene ſometime intercept the light from vs, or men be blind, and cannot ſee it: or as a houſe ſhut vp and reſtrained, that the perſons therein cannot come abroade, nor the towne ſee that which the family doeth within: ſo the Church neuer ceaſſeth to profeſſe and make her faith knowne to ſome, though ſhe do it not to otherſome, and ſome haue no eyes to ſee it.</p>

Thirdly, all the perſons and companies in the world profeſſing Chriſt, were neuer aſſembled into one place, ſo that they might all of them be ſeene.

But the Ieſuite auouching the mixture of good and badde in the militant Church, which we grant, to proue the Catholicke Church conſiſteth of all ſorts, reaſoneth to no purpoſe.

Cyprian ſaith, <hi>The Lords Church being enuironed with his light, reacheth his beames ouer all the world.</hi> Which words, being in all points like Origens, receiue the ſame anſwer. For by this light, he meaneth the vnitie of the Church, as appeareth by his next words: <hi>This light is one which is ſpred euery where, and the vnitie of the bodie is not ſeparated:</hi> now this vnitie, as all other inward graces and ornaments of the Church, may with her ſelfe be ſpred all ouer the world, and yet not viſibly to the view of all therein, but by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the hearts of her children ſcattered all ouer the world. Yet I deny not but the Church was openly knowne in Cyprians time, though very poore and perſecuted, but that proueth not it ſhould alway be ſo. Chryſoſtome ſaith, <hi>The Sunne ſhall ſooner be put out, then the Church obſcured:</hi> but by obſcuring he meaneth not the hiding of it for a time out of the ſight of her enemies, but the totall extinguiſhing and vtter aboliſhing of it. Which will eaſily appeare if the greeke word vſed for obſcuring, be looked; now that may be hidden for a time which is not extinguiſhed, as we ſee in the Sun wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chryſoſtome compareth the Church. Againe it is neuer
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1857:75"/> obſcured from thoſe that liue in it, which profeſſe the faith; and yet the world may be ignorant of it, as a blind man ſeeth not the Sunne, which yeeldeth light to others that haue eyes to ſee. And that Chryſoſtome thought the Church might ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be inuiſible, appeareth by the 49. homily vpon Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: where he ſaith, <hi>That ſince the time that hereſies haue inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Church, it can no way be knowne which is the true Church of Chriſt, but by the Scriptures onely. In this confuſion it can no wayes elſe be knowne.</hi> Auſtin ſaith, <hi>There is no certaintie of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie but through the promiſes of God declared to his Church, which being ſet vpon a hill, cannot be hidde. My brethren, ſhall I ſhew you the Church with my finger? is it not manifeſt? what ſhall I ſay more but that they are blind which ſee not ſo great a hill, which ſhut their eyes againſt a light ſet vpon a candleſticke?</hi> In which words he ſpeaketh againſt a conceit of the Donatiſts, who boaſted, as the Papiſts now do, that the Church was no where but among them; affirming them to be blind that could not ſee it all ouer Affricke, ſeeing it was at that time as plaine as a mountain, or a candle lighted; which we grant, and againſt the Papiſts affirme of our owne Church at this day. But his words implie not that this viſible eſtate thereof ſo manifeſt in his time, could no time be hid. For cities built vpon a hil are not viſible at euery time, as in a great miſt, or in the night; neither is the Sunne alway alike cleare, or in one horizon; neither could<note n="i" place="margin">2. Reg. 6.16</note> the Aramites ſee the hill it ſelfe where the Prophet of God was, and horſes, and chariots of fire round about him. Therefore Auſtins words muſt be vnderſtood of that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time, and not ſtretched to all times alike. For he is blinde which at noone dayes cannot ſee the Sunne light, but the Sun may ſet or be eclipſed, and then they are not all blind that ſee it not: as himſelfe ſpeaketh plainly in other places, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compared with theſe, will giue vs their true meaning:<note n="k" place="margin">Epiſt. 48. ad Vincent.</note>

For though that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which is offered to me as the Church, be more apparent to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1857:80"/> my ſence, yet haue I no certaintie that it is the Church or a companie ſo qualified, vntil I know the faith thereof to be true. I ſee indeed a company of men, and heare much of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but I am not ſure they are the Church, vnleſſe I know they hold the true faith, and ſo the knowledge of this leadeth me to the knowledge of that, and the faith is eaſilier diſcerned then the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Papiſts themſelues haue a ſaying, which if this Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite would receiue, might determine this matter: <hi>We ſee indeed that companie of men which is the Church,</hi>

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p n="1">1 This is the ſecond argument, and is concluded in this Syllogiſme.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That is no marke or meanes to know the Church by, which it ſelf is vnknowne to vs till the Church teach it; and is learned by the meanes and miniſtery of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is the true faith, that we cannot know it til the Church teach it vs, and it ſelfe is learned by the meanes and miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Church: for God instructeth no man immediatly, but by the preaching of the Church, as Saint Paul ſaith, Rom. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the true faith is not a ſufficient marke to finde the Church by.</p>
               </q>
               <p>For anſwer to this argument, it will eaſily be granted, that <hi>the miniſtery of the Church is the ordinary meanes whereby we learne the faith of Chriſt, and that no man of himſelfe can attaine to the knowledge thereof, but as the Church teacheth him.</hi> This I ſay is granted, ſo it be well vnderſtood. For the ſpirit of God in the Scripture is the principall ſchoolemaſter, from whom all truth cometh, and which openeth the heart to beleeue; and the Church is it which by her miniſtery holdeth this truth before vs: and therefore, except in ſome extraordinary caſes, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thereof is required as <hi>a neceſſary condition,</hi> as the text of Saint Paul ſpeaketh.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But hence it followeth not, that therefore the Church is rather a marke of the faith, then the faith a marke of the Church: for theſe two, the true Church and the true faith, are like relatiues inſeparably vnited together by a certaine order and reſpect either to other; as a ſchool-maſter and his teaching: ſo that the one proueth and declareth the other, as cauſes and effects vſe to do. In which kind of prouing, the order is, that firſt the effect ſheweth the cauſe, it being ordinarie that a cauſe cannot be aſſured ſo to be, but by the effect which it produceth and offereth vnto vs: as a ſchoole-maſter is not knowne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſo to be but by his teaching. And if among many bad, you would find a good one, to whom you might commit your
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1857:82"/> children; this cannot be done but by hearing and examining his maner of teaching: in which caſe though the man be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie meanes whereby you learne his teaching, yet the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it ſelfe is the marke whereby you know him to be ſuch a man, and diſtinguiſh him fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m all others. And euen as the tree beareth his fruite, and we ſeeke the tree principally for this end, that by it as by <hi>a neceſſary meanes</hi> we may find the fruite; and yet the fruite it ſheweth vs is the onely marke that it is ſuch a tree; and if it be denied or doubted, the taſting of the fruite wil proue it, and diſtinguiſh it from all the trees in the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. So likewiſe as he ſaith, the Church expoundeth the faith vnto vs, and we ſeeke the Church principally for this end, that by it, as by the meanes, we may learne the truth: and yet this truth which it ſheweth vs, may be the marke to aſſure vs it is ſuch a Church, and to diſtinguiſh it from all other Churches in the world. Therefore for the Church to teach the faith, and the faith to be a note of the Church, are not oppoſite, but onely diuers, and ſo may both be true: as a light vpon a watch-tower in the darke night may be the onely marke whereby to find the tower, and yet the tower it ſelf holdeth out the light, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and is the meanes that the traueller ſeeth it.</p>
               <p n="28">§. 28. Thirdly, true faith is a thing included in the true Church, and as it were incloſed in her bellie: as S. Auguſt ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2 But the firſt propoſition, that becauſe <hi>it is included in the Church,</hi> and <hi>the Church teacheth it, therefore it can be no marke of the Church,</hi> is denied: becauſe true faith is incloſed in the Church, not obſcurely as gold is in a mans belly, ſo as<note n="c" place="margin">Ioſeph. de bello Iud. l. 6. c. 15.</note> we reade <hi>the Iewes vſed to ſwallow it, thereby to hide it from their enemies;</hi> but as a candle in a lanterne, or a light in his watch-tower, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering both it ſelfe and the place that holdeth it, which gold in a mans belly cannot do.

               <p n="1">1 Becauſe this reaſon is the ſame with that which goeth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1857:85"/> before, therefore it ſhall receiue the ſame anſwer: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we need the miniſterie of the Church to teach vs the faith, and this faith is not ordinarily knowne till the Church, or ſome member thereof reueale it to vs; yet may it be a marke whereby to know the Church, as the effect is a marke of the cauſe that produceth it: the fruite of the tree, the teaching of the ſchoolemaiſter. In which caſe the reuelation of the true faith, whereby we come to know it, is an effect or worke of the Church, and ſo able and fit to aſſure vs that it is the Church. Neither doth this ſuppoſe or imply, that the faith is already had and knowne by other meanes before we vſe the Church, but onely that when the Church teacheth, the faith thereof, in the order of my vnderſtanding, is firſt knowne: that is to ſay, the Church and the faith being inſeparably ioyned together, yet the faith firſt cometh to my knowledge. This I further explicate by a ſimilitude. For muſick is the marke of a Muſitian, whereby to know him, and to diſtinguiſh him from all other profeſſions. And though I muſt firſt be aſſured it is good muſicke that he ſheweth, before I can be certaine he is a Muſitian; yet were it folly to reaſon, as the Ieſuite doth, what need then is there for the getting of the muſicke already had, to vſe the miniſterie of the Muſitian? for the muſicke is not already had, but onely by his playing it cometh in order before himſelfe into my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and then I know him thereby. So<note n="a" place="margin">1.

And if the Ieſuite ſhould reaſon againſt Salomons iudgement, that he had followed <hi>a wrong marke, which was incloſed in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, and needed great iudgement, yea diuine illumination, to find it: the woman her ſelfe, by her ſpeech and behauiour, made it knowne to him: and if pietie and pitie were the note of a true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1857:86"/> whereby to know her, then contrary to that which hath bene already proued, the ſpeech and behauiour of the mother ſhould not be a neceſſary meanes whereby Salomon muſt come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this pietie, &amp;c.</hi> If, I ſay, he ſhould thus argue againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, he might do it with the ſame reaſon that he vſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, and poſſible with as good ſucceſſe;<note n="*" place="margin">V. vltim.</note> the ſpirit of God, and the iudgement of all Iſrael, in both alike equally condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſophiſtry. For was not the womans pitie toward the child knowne to Salomons wiſedome before he knew her to be the mother, and yet her ſelfe was the inſtrument that made it knowne? So true faith is the mark of the Church, and known to me before the Church, but yet by no other meanes but by the Church, whoſe miniſtery is needful for the getting it; as the cauſe is needfull for the obtaining of the effect, and afterward it ſelfe is proued by the ſame effect. Now the teaching of the truth is an effect of the true Church.</p>

               <p n="5">5 And whereas he obiecteth further, that <hi>the Church is a company of men, wiſe, learned, vertuous, and guided by the ſpirit of God, and therefore it is raſhneſſe to iudge of their teaching;</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that this ill befits him and his cauſe: for<note n="c" place="margin">Digreſſ. 16. nu. 4.</note> I haue ſhewed that his Church conſiſteth rather in the Popes ſole perſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any great company, and the definitions thereof follow not the learning or vertue of any company, but the Popes bare will; who, by the confeſſion of all learned Papiſts may both erre, and be as vitious, fooliſh, and vnlearned as any other. <hi>And therefore the Church with her prerogatiues can do a Papist no good, vntill they be taken from the Pope and giuen the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine</hi> Next, though the company which is the Church, <hi>be wiſe and learned, &amp;c.</hi> yet are they no wiſer then Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whoſe teaching was examined; neither can we know them for ſuch till we haue tryed their teaching.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1857:88"/> and the Ieſuite may know it is not in his ſence by this ſigne, that the very perſons and particular Churches to whom Chriſt meant thoſe words, had their errors for all that. But ſuppoſing the Churches doctrine, by vertue of ſome ſuch promiſe, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed abſolutely exempted from all error, yet may the ſame be examined and iudged of, <hi>becauſe till that be done, it cannot of vs be knowne to be ſo.</hi> For no man ſaith, we muſt proue things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy certaine, but that we muſt not beleeue them to be certaine till we haue proued them.

But you may perhaps obiect, that in Scripture we are willed not to beleeue euery ſpirit, but to examine and trie the ſpirits whether they be of God or no; and that therefore we muſt examine and trie the ſpirit of the Church. I anſwer, that S. Iohn doth not meane that it appertaineth to euerie man to trie all ſpirits, but in generall would not haue the Church to accept of euery one that boaſteth himſelfe to haue the Spirit, but willeth that they ſhould trie thoſe ſpirits: not that euery ſimple man ſhould take vpon him thus to trie them, but that thoſe of the Church ſhould trie them to whom the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of trying the ſpirits doth appertaine; to wit, the Doctors and Paſtors of the Church, which almightie God hath put of purpoſe in the Church, <hi>Vt non circumferamur omni vent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But when it is once certaine that the ſpirit is of God, we neither neede nor ought doubtfully to examine, nor preſumptuouſly iudge or it any more, but obediently ſubmitting the iudgement of our owne ſenſe and reaſon, we muſt beleeue the teaching of it in euery point. Now it is moſt certaine, that the ſpirit of the true Church is of God, as out of holy Scripture
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1857:89"/> hath bene moſt euidently declared: and therefore our onely care ſhould be to ſeeke out thoſe markes and properties by which all men may eaſily know which particular companie of men is the true Church, which we ought not to examine and trie, but in all points obediently beleeue.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p n="1">1 The words of the Apoſtle are, <hi>Dearly beloued, beleeue not euery ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they be of God,</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.1. Whence we gather, that it is the dutie of euery man to examine the doctrine that is taught him. But the Ieſuite anſwereth two things: firſt, that Saint Iohn biddeth not euery man do this, but onely the Paſtors. Whereto I anſwer, the words are plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that he ſpeaketh indifferently to all men, that euery man for himſelfe, though not by himſelfe, but by the rule of Gods word, ſhould try the ſpirits. For he directeth his Epiſtle not to the cleargie, but to the people. And the reaſon added why they ſhould trie the ſpirits, maketh it plaine who the parties be that ſhould trie them: <hi>for many falſe Prophets are gone out:</hi> they muſt trie the ſpirits that are in danger to be ſeduced by falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſuch are the people, and therefore they muſt examine them, as Chriſt ſaith,<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 7.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets; by their fruites,</hi> that is, by their doctrine, <hi>ye ſhall know them,</hi> and yet they cannot be knowne by their doctrine vnleſſe it be firſt examined. And Saint Baſil<note n="b" place="margin">Eth. definit. 72. pag. 432. Graec. Baſ.</note> ſaith, <hi>It behoueth the hearers which are learned in the Scriptures, to examine the things which are ſpoken by their teachers; and receiuing thoſe things which are conſonant with the Scriptures, to refuſe the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 And whereas the Ieſuite auoucheth his conceit by a text of Epheſ. 4.11. wherein it is ſaid, that <hi>Christ hath left to his Church Pastors and Doctors, that henceforth we be no more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wauering and caried about with euery wind of doctrine:</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith not, that our Paſtors were giuen vs that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhould no more trie the ſpirits; but <hi>for the worke of the ministery, for the gathering together of the Saints, for the building of the body of Chriſt:</hi> all which dutie of theirs is much furthered when the people vnder them trie all things, and hold that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1857:89"/> which is good, and by examining their teaching, find them to be Doctors of the truth. And if Saint Paul had miſliked this, then the men of Beroea had not bene<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> commended by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God for examining his doctrine; neither would he haue<note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> warned the Hebrewes, that <hi>through long cuſtome they ſhould haue their wits exerciſed to diſcerne both good and euill.</hi> And to reply, that they diſcerne it becauſe the Church telleth them what it is, is too groſſe: for they cannot tel whether the Church ſay true or no, till they haue examined what it ſaith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In the ſecond place he anſwereth, that <hi>the ſpirits which muſt be tried, are not the ſpirits of the Church</hi> which are of God, <hi>but onely ſuch ſpirits of which we may doubt whether they be of God or no;</hi> then the which he could haue ſpoken nothing more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſedly, becauſe if it be lawfull to trie ſuch ſpirits as are ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or falſe, then is it alſo lawfull to proue the true: for two contrary ſpirits be relatiues, ſo that we cannot proue the one to be falſe, but we muſt needs withal proue the other to be true. Againe, when we doubt whether the ſpirit be of God, then we are not certaine; and if the falſe ſpirit be not certainly falſe, then neither is the true ſpirit certainly true, in my vnderſtanding till I haue tried it. Moreouer, there is nothing ſo true in it ſelfe, but it may be doubtfull to vs till we haue tried it; and therefore the pureſt ſpirits are not exempt from examination: ſpecially conſidering that it is no iniury to the truth, which loueth to be ſifted, if ye proue it by his word<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 18.37.</note> that was borne to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the truth, and the more ye trie it, the clearer it is: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be grieuance to the ſpirit of God, who<note n="f" place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.21.</note> calleth vpon vs <hi>to trie all things, and hold that which is good;</hi> and biddeth vs <hi>haue our wits exerciſed to diſcerne betweene good and euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 And his concluſion, that when it is certaine the ſpirit is of God, then we muſt no longer doubtfully examine it, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently accept it, ſaith very well: for<note n="g" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.7.</note> the Apoſtle rebuketh ſuch as are <hi>alway learning, and neuer come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> but he forgetteth that ſo it neuer is, till we haue tried it, and therefore we may firſt examine it, that afterwards we may be <hi>certaine</hi> and <hi>obedient.</hi> And though it be moſt certaine, that <hi>the ſpirit of the true Church is of God,</hi> yet hence it followeth not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1857:90"/> that we muſt ſeeke this Church by other markes, and not by her teaching: for thoſe other markes which the Ieſuite meaneth, are of God too as well as the teaching is, and yet he will allow them to be examined. And firſt to examine and trie, and then obediently to beleeue, are not contrary but ſubordinate, and the one the way to the other. And Chriſt was of God, yet<note n="h" place="margin">Ioh 5.39.</note> he bad men <hi>ſearch the Scripture</hi> for his triall: and all we being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the heires of vnbeleefe, cannot haue this certaintie in our ſelues till the diſcourſe of Gods word haue created it in vs. And if there were nothing elſe to leade vs, yet the experience which we haue had of the Church of Romes dealing, were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to warne vs, that we neuer giue ouer Saint Iohns leſſon, <hi>Beleeue not euery ſpirit, but trie them whether they be of God.</hi>

Thirdly, when ſuch a head as himſelf meaneth, admitting it alſo to be the Pope, were

For example, whereas in the Sacrament they thinke the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of bread and wine paſſe away, the formes, or accidents, onely remaining; the queſtion is, <hi>in what ſubiect, or ſubſtance theſe accidents abide?</hi> Some ſay they remaine ſeparated without any ſubiect: this is the opinion of Occham, Biel, Cameracenſis, Maior, and the Nominals. Some that they obtain a way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to exiſt of themſelues: this is the opinion of Marſilius. Some that they haue their inherence in the quantitie: this is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Thomas, Bonauenture, Soto, Egidius, Suarez, and others. Some, that they abide with that exiſtence which they had in the bread and wine before conſecration: this is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Dominicus Bannes. Some, that the body of Chriſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth them by his preſence: this is the opinion of Palacio. Another queſtion is, how the accidents remaining after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration haue power to nouriſh? and whereof it is that worms, or ſuch like corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is ingendred in the hoaſt? Some ſay, the matter hereof is made of the ayre that is round about the formes: this is the opinion of ſome mentioned by Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine. Some, that the ſubſtance of bread and wine returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and from it proceedeth this nutrition or generation: this is the opinion of Innocent, Bonauenture, and Alexander. Some, that of the quantity remaining, the matter of the thing bred or nouriſhed, is ingendred, whereinto the bread would haue turned if it had remained: this is the opinon of Aquine. Some, that the accidents receiue poſſibility to be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this matter: this is the opinion of Richard. Some, that when the accidents begin to corrupt, there returneth a ſubſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, not the former ſubſtance of bread, but a new that was

The ſumme of that which he ſaith, is briefly this:
<q>
                     <p>They which acknowledge one chiefe Paſtor, to wit, the Pope, to whoſe definitiue ſentence in all matters they ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, cannot poſſibly diſſent.</p>

                  </q> The ſecond propoſition he aſſumeth as granted, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be vntrue, as I will ſhew: the firſt he proueth thus:

                     <p>But the Pope hath this authoritie and infallibilitie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they which ſubmit themſelues to the Pope, cannot diſſent.</p>
                  </q> The ſecond propoſition he confirmeth thus:
<q>
                     <p>We know, that to S. Peter and his ſucceſſors Christ promiſed the keyes; and ſayd, vpon them as vpon a rocke, he would build his Church: praying for them that their faith ſhould not faile, and bidding them ſtrengthen their brethren, and feede his

                     <p>The Pope therefore hath this authoritie and infallibilitie.</p>

Theſe had many on their ſide that ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhop of Rome; and that which afterwards tooke vp the controuerſie, was not his authoritie, but the Councell of Nice. Now it is very probable, that if theſe Biſhops had thought the ſubiection mentioned by the Ieſuit, to the Biſhop of Rome, were neceſſarily required to the eſſence of vnitie, they would haue yeelded; wheras by their reſiſtance it is plaine they thought themſelues bound to his determination no more then he might thinke himſelfe bound to theirs.</p>

Firſt, they reckon vp diuers circumſtances going with the text, to proue that <hi>Chriſt ſpake to Peter onely:</hi> which no man deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But the ſpeaking to Peter maketh him not chiefe, vnleſſe the words ſpoken ſignifie that which ſhould be contained in the ſoueraigntie. Beſides, though now he ſpake to Peter onely, yet all the matter ſpoken, belonged to the reſt as well as to him. Secondly, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Simon, loueſt thou me more then theſe?</hi> Why doth he examine him of his loue more then the reſt, but that he intended him more authoritie? I anſwer, to make him ſee his fault, who hauing lately vndertooke more then all, euen to die with him though all ſhould forſake him, yet when it came to triall, performed leſſe then any, denying him thriſe, which none elſe did. And poſſible alſo to let him know his ſinne was pardoned,<note n="x" place="margin">Luc. 7.47.</note> becauſe more is forgiuen to him that loueth more. Thirdly, he not onely examineth him of his loue, but alſo thereby draweth out of him <hi>a feruent confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</hi> I anſwer, this he did alſo in regard of his former ſinne,<note n="y" place="margin">Iſid. Peluſiot. l. 1. Ep. 103.</note> by a threefold confeſſion to heale his threefold deniall, and to aſſure his fellow diſciples of his repentance, and to ſhew, by his example, how deare the loue of Chriſt ſhould be to them that meddle with feeding Chriſts flocke. Fourthly, he biddeth him <hi>Feed,</hi> and feeding is <hi>Ruling with fulneſſe of power.</hi> I anſwer, he biddeth him feed his ſheepe and lambes, which are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and not the Apoſtles properly, which proueth that feeding hath no ſuch meaning. Beſides, feeding ſignifieth ruling not euery way, but in ſuch maner as appertaineth to the perſons that do feed. And therefore in kings it is to rule with fulneſſe of power, but in Paſtors with the word and diſcipline onely,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1857:127"/> as appeareth by this, that all Biſhops and teachers are called<note n="z" place="margin">Eph 4.11.</note> Paſtors, and bidden<note n="a" place="margin">Ier. 3.15 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zec. 34 Act. 20.28. 1. Pet. 5.1.</note> feede the flocke of Chriſt, and yet no man thinketh they are made Popes thereby. Laſtly Peter is bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Feed the ſheepe,</hi> &amp; the Apoſtles are a part of Chriſts ſheep, therefore he muſt feed them. I anſwer, this is granted, but then feeding ſignifieth no more but edifying by word and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and ſo as Peter muſt feed the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles muſt feed him againe, by the ſame commandement of Chriſt<note n="b" place="margin">Marc. 16.</note> that bade them preach the Goſpell to euery creature: as<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 2.</note> Paul fed him at Antioch by reproofe. And whereas ſome vrge that <hi>the ſheepe</hi> ſignifie the vniuerſall Church, becauſe Chriſt ſaith not theſe are thoſe ſheepe in particular, but my ſheeepe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſo Peter is ſet ouer the vniuerſall Church: this is but a ſpeculation: for if the Church be ſtrained into ſo wide a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, he could not feed it, becauſe he could feed no more then that part which was in his time, or followed after him: wherein the other Apoſtles fed in community with him, and feeding was not Poping. Thus we ſee that vnleſſe the Papiſts may be allowed to racke the words of Scripture beyond all compaſſe of ordinary vnderſtanding, and bring to them the ſence which they ſhould fetch from them, there is nothing in all the Bible ſufficient to vphold any part of that wherein they are ſo confident.</p>

               <p n="1">1 How well the Romane Church is linked together, I haue ſaid in the former ſection: and therefore if the Ieſuit will aſſigne a difference betweene it and heretickes (which will be the ſame that is betweene fiſh and herrings) he muſt do it by ſomthing elſe then by their vnitie: wherunto Saint Cyprian gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no teſtimony in the words alledged, but that it pleaſed the Ieſuite thereby to impoſe vpon his ignorant reader. For firſt he ſpeaketh not, in any of both places, concerning the Church of Rome, but of euery part of the Church wherſoeuer, &amp; ſaith, <hi>It is a company adhering to their Paſtour, &amp;c.</hi> Next, by this one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and iudge, whereto the Church adhereth, he meaneth not the Biſhop of Rome ouer all the world, (for himſelfe diſſented from him in the cauſe of appeales and rebaptization) but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Biſhop in his owne circuit. Thirdly, ſuppoſing he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited the Pope, and by theſe words immediatly meant him, yet what is that to the Pope now, who is degenerate into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creature then at that time he was? whereby it cometh to paſſe that many good things might be ſaid of him then, that cannot now, and of his Church then, which ſince that time are periſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But the truth is, that ſaying the Church is a people clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to their Prieſt, he meaneth it not of al Gods Church clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the Pope, but of euery particular Church obeying their Paſtour, according to Saint Pauls admonition,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note>

For the Noua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at Carthage, in a ſchiſme had made them a Biſhop of their owne, and written to the Church of Rome falſly, that he was lawfully elected: the which being againſt the cuſtome and peace of the Church, moued him to vrge, as you ſee, the vnitie of one Biſhop, and to defend the Church-gouernment of that

               <p n="1">1 For anſwer to this, the Proteſtants haue two things to ſay. Firſt, that it is falſe, their men be more wicked then the Papiſts in old time were, the which is proued by comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and let that compariſon giue the triall in the next Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And whereas the Ieſuite ſaith, <hi>They can tell that haue ſeene both,</hi> I anſwer, this is true, and therefore let vs referre our ſelues to their reports, which by and by ſhal be ſet downe. And in the meane time it is probable, the Papiſts in old time were ſuch as they be now; which if they were, I am contented our liues be layed together and compared. For the preſent expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that we haue this day in England touching Papiſts and their conuerſations, will acquit vs, though their outrage and confuſion be ſuch, and haue wrought vs that ſorow, that we can

And let it be obſerued, if all diſorders be not rifeſt in thoſe parts among vs where the people is moſt Pope-holy: other pariſhes where the Goſpell hath bene taught, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ciuilitie, and the reſt that ſwarme with Prieſts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants remaining ſauage and barbarous, that no Chriſtian man may endure their manners. And for mine owne part, hauing ſpent much of my time among them, this I haue found, that in all exceſſe of ſinne Papiſts haue bene the ringleaders, in rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous companies, in drunken meetings, in ſeditious aſſemblies and practiſes, in profaning the Sabboth, in quarels and braules, in ſtage-playes, greenes, ales, and all heatheniſh cuſtomes: the common people of that ſort generally buried in ſinne, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more then can be expreſſed, vncleanneſſe, drunkenneſſe, perfidiouſneſſe vile and odious: their families vntaught and diſſolute, their behauiour fierce, and full of all contumely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, inhumanitie, full of ſlanderous reports, wilde lookes, and all vnchriſtian vſage towards any not of their owne religion; that I dare be bold to ſay, we may all caſt our caps at them for atheiſme and all that naught is: the which I would not haue touched, becauſe ſome wil miſlike it, but that the Ieſuits words. <hi>They can tell that haue ſeene both,</hi> vrge me to it: and hauing ſeen it with mine owne eyes, and ſmarted a long time vnder it, I thought it would be to the glory of God, and confuſion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie, to let the truth be knowne, and to admoniſh the Prieſts lurking in the countrey, if they will needs make the world Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catholicke yet that they teach it more ciuilitie withall.</p>
               <p n="2">2 His next reaſon to proue our Church vnholy, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Luther and Smideline. And do not the Prophets and Apoſtles complaine as much againſt the Church in their times, which yet was the true Church of God? What age, or people,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1857:129"/> or Church was euer yet ſo holy, but the preachers thereof found matter of reproofe in it? I, but Luther ſaith, <hi>Men are now much worſe then when they were Papiſts:</hi> he ſaith ſo indeed, but he addeth withall, that <hi>the cauſe hereof is, for that men receiue not the doctrine of Chriſt, therefore God in his anger giueth them vp to their owne ſinnes:</hi> wherein he chargeth not the true beleeuers of our faith, but onely ſuch hypocrites as made a ſhew without ſinceritie. The very like complaint is in Chryſoſtome of the Church in his time: <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Op. imperſ. in Math. hom. 49.</note> he) <hi>Chriſtians are become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch as heretickes and Pagans be, or worſe: yea and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation of life, though it be in ſchiſme, is with more continencie from ſinne then among the Chriſtians.</hi> Here Chryſoſtome ſaith, the Chriſtians are <hi>worſe then Pagans,</hi> as Luther ſaith, they are <hi>worſe then Papiſts;</hi> and yet the Ieſuite dareth not conclude, that therefore the Pagans, and not the Chriſtians were the true Church. For hypocrites are alway mingled with the Saints, as chaffe is with the wheate, and by their ſinne bring a ſhew of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vpon the whole Church, and is imputed vnto it. But Saint Auguſtine anſwereth this obiection better then I can, which if our aduerſaries would marke, this complaint of our vnholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe were ſoone at an end: <hi>And now</hi> (<note n="b" place="margin">Epiſt. 161.</note> ſaith he) <hi>the faults of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men are caſt in our teeth, not ours neither, but other mens, and they alſo in part vnknowne; the which if we did ſee to be true and preſent before our eyes, and ſparing the cockle for the wheate ſake, did tolerate in regard of vnitie: he would thinke vs not onely worthy of no reproofe, but of great praiſe.</hi> And Ierome is of minde, the ſinnes of the Church are no vantage to heretickes: thus he ſaith:<note n="c" place="margin">Ep. 78.</note>

Now the Ieſuite will not deny but theſe were Saints, and by miracles approued ſo to be.

And this is a ſufficient token of our holineſſe, and herby we know our ſelues to be the Saints of God: the which if the Ieſuite will deny, then let him proue, either that we teach not true iuſtification and ſanctification; or if we teach it, and haue it, yet it is no argument of true holines; or if it be, yet that it is not euident enough without miracles to demonſtrate the Church: or if miracles be ſo neceſſary, then let him ſhew we haue no part in thoſe which the Apoſtles did, &amp; others after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The point we denie is this, that our owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the thing that muſt anſwer the law of God, or by way of merite, procure acceptation with God to eternall life, or make vs righteous in his preſence. For God of his iuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that euery man, afore he be ſaued or admitted into the ſtate of his children to enioy his fauour and friendſhip, bring a full ſatisfaction and righteouſneſſe or iuſtice of workes anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the law: the which iuſtice, ſay we, is not the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that we do, but the perfect obedience of Chriſt imputed to vs, and made ours by faith; our owne workes being only the fruite of this faith, and a requiſite condition of our ſaluation, as the way to walke in, and no otherwiſe; which way whoſoeuer findeth not, or hauing found it, walketh not, ſhall neuer be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe God ſaueth none but by iuſtification and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation both: the former is to acquit them from the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the law, and it is by the bloud and obedience of Chriſt; the latter is to conforme them to the Goſpel, and to go the way that leadeth to God; and it is by our owne inherent holineſſe. Both theſe muſt therefore of neceſſitie be done: the obedience of Chriſt to iuſtifie vs, and our owne works to go the way whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our iuſtification calleth vs; whereupon it followeth, they neither iuſtifie, nor ſatisfie, nor merite before God, nor anſwer
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1857:140"/> the righteouſneſſe of his law; and yet are abſolutely neceſſary as the fruites of faith and markes of the way that leadeth to heauen. And euen as the king freely beſtowing a place in the Court vpon his ſubiect, this his free gift bindeth him ouer to come to the Court and receiue it, and hauing ſo done, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcharge the place with all diligence and attendance: and yet the ſubiect cannot ſay, that either his going the way or atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance procured him the place, but onely the kings free gift put him into it: and if this mans friend ſometime tell him, you muſt go to the Court and do your attendance, though, when you haue done all you can, your ſo doing is not worthy the kings fauour he hath ſhewed you; he doth not thereby perſwade him to neglect his iourney &amp; ſeruice, but rather the contrarie, that the kings gift calling him to the place implieth both. So is it in our ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the way that leadeth to the kingdom that God hath freely giuen vs, and the dutie which that gift calleth vs to; and therefore neceſſary in it owne kind and order &amp; no otherwiſe.

No man hauing freely beſtowed a gift vpon another, is bound by the good vſe of the ſaid gift to beſtow more; but he that receiueth it is rather bound to him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it. But all the workes of grace whatſoeuer, though neuer ſo well vſed, are freely beſtowed vpon vs by God: therefore God is not bound by the good vſe thereof to beſtow more.

And though Ieſus Chriſt haue brought grace to the law, that is to ſay by the reuelation of his Goſpell hath in ſome ſort altered it, yet that grace ſtandeth not in dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the commandements, or enabling vs here to keepe it without defect, but in abſoluing vs from the rigour of it, and working the obedience of the Goſpell in our hearts. The rigor of the law admitteth no righteouſneſſe but that which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perfect, it offereth vs iuſtification and eternall life vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other condition, it adiudgeth euery man to hell for the leaſt ſinne, and condemneth all ſuch as faile in perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and this rigour ſtandeth in force toward all that are out of Chriſt: and though the grace of Chriſt haue deliuered his children from it, yet this deliuerance we ſee implieth not their exemption from ſinning, but onely ſuppoſeth three other things.

Next, that the power of it ſhall be abated in them, by reaſon the death of Chriſt hath mortified the luſt of the fleſh. Thirdly, that they are freed from the law thus armed with rigor, and admitted to the obedience of the Goſpell which is a yoke lighter and eaſier. And we hold that all the perfection of mans righteouſneſſe in this life ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely in bearing this yoke, the commandements whereof are three, and we think it not impoſſible to keep them.

The 2. is faith, beleeuing in Chriſt for the remiſſion of our ſinnes. The third is new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, conſiſting in the mortification of the fleſh, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpirit, that we may endeuour and preſſe our ſelues forward to do our vttermoſt in walking the way of all the

               <p n="38">38 But becauſe, either through ignorance or malice, it is miſreported to the people, who are made beleeue that thereby we exclude the neceſſitie of a godly life: therefore I will briefly expound the meaning of this propoſition, By faith onely we are iuſtified. Wherein there are three termes: the firſt is iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and thereby we meane Gods acceptation of a ſinner
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1857:153"/> to grace and glorie. For man being guiltie of the breach of Gods law, and ſo ſubiect to the penaltie thereof, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, cannot be reſtored againe vnleſſe he bring a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to ſatisfie this law againe; that is to ſay, which may anſwer both the obedience that it requireth, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that it inflicteth. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the law being part of Gods will, and being giuen to man out of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, muſt take his effect: elſe God ſhould leaue his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vnſatisfied, and depart from his nature,<note n="ſ" place="margin">Mat. 5 18.</note> which is vnpoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This righteouſneſſe we affirme to be not our owne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent iuſtice, but the obedience of Chriſt alone, whereby he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the whole law moſt perfectly for vs. We denie not but euery ſeruant of God hath in him true ſanctification and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, enabling him to repentance, ſatisfaction, faith, hope and charitie; but we denie theſe or any of them to be the iuſtice whereby the bond of Gods law is anſwered, and we appeare righteous before Gods iudgement ſeate, partly becauſe they are vnperfect, and partly for that we do them not by our owne ſtrength. But the very thing that maketh vs accepted as iuſt, is the obedience of Chriſt, whereby he fulfilled the law, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the puniſhment in his life and death for vs: which obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both merited the remiſſion of our ſins, and effectually wrought the righteouſnes of the law. For the deriuing whereof vnto vs, two things muſt be done: one on Gods behalfe, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on our owne. That which God doth, is called imputation of Chriſts obedience to vs for the pardon of our ſins, and the making of our perſons acceptable, as if our ſelues had neuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. That which we do, is beleeuing in Chriſt, and ſo receiuing that which God offereth: both which actions when they meet, Gods offering Chriſt, and our receiuing him, the iuſtification of a ſinner is then formally accompliſhed.</p>
               <p n="39">39 The next terme is faith: whereby we do not meane ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fleeting opinion of Gods fauour ſtanding onely in ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, nor yet, as our aduerſaries define it onely <hi>an aſſent vnto all thoſe things which God hath reuealed, beleeuing them to be true:</hi> but we hold it to be ouer and beſides this,<note n="*" place="margin">Nec fides ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludit omnem dubitationem; ſed dubitatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vincentem &amp; trahentem in oppoſitum cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilis. Scot. 3. d. 23.</note> an infallible knowledge and apprehenſion of Gods good will towards vs
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1857:153"/> in particular, whereby we apply the ſpeciall promiſes of the Goſpell to our owne ſelues: the which knowledge we hold is obtained two wayes: one is by the inward teſtimonie of Gods ſpirit witneſſing with our ſpirit, that God doth now accept vs for his ſons in Chriſt: the other leading hereunto, is by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of the Goſpell, promiſing iuſtification to all that do the things required therein, whereto, when we by the grace of God and a liuing faith performe them, our conſcience enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with the truth, anſwereth, We haue done them. By this meanes we ſay a man may be able to beleeue Chriſt to be his Sauiour, and ſo beleeuing he apprehendeth the promiſe, and is iuſtified by his faith as by an inſtrument; that is to ſay, this his conſent and obedient yeelding himſelfe to beleeue Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his Sauiour and his ſpeciall promiſes, is as it were the hand whereby a ſinner muſt receiue Chriſts obedience for his iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And if it be obicted, that no man can thus beleeue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth not the wil of God, or if he do beleeue thus, he may deceiue himſelfe: I anſwer, that it is in no mans power to attain to this knowledge of himſelf, but as God reuealeth it and worketh it in vs by his word and Spirit, infuſing it ſecretly into our conſciences by the preaching of the Goſpell, and our faith and obedience thereunto, as a man heareth his friend tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him a ſecret in his eare: wherein if one be diligent and faithfull, it will worke three effects in him. Firſt it will humble him and ſhew him his miſery, and ſo driue him to Chriſt for helpe. Secondly it will conuert his life, and of a profane perſon make him a godly man. Thirdly it will infuſe and drop into him by degrees the feeling of Gods good will toward him, and ſo inſpire him with comfort: from all which he may as infallibly by faith conclude his redemption, as if his name were written in the Bible. Which I declare by a ſimilitude of a King, who ſending a pardon to fortie thouſand rebels, ſetteth not downe their names in particular, but putteth in a condition, that all they ſhall be pardoned that wil lay by their weapons and come to him: the which he ſendeth a herald to proclaime, and the people hearing it do accordingly, and thereby know infallibly they are pardoned: and if any man would moleſt them becauſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1857:154"/> their name is not expreſly written in the pardon, they might contemne him, and ſecurely conclude their deliuerance from the condition that is expreſſed. In the ſame maner do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our iuſtification by faith. For all men being ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, he hath ſent out the pardon of his Goſpell, not writing any mans name therein particularly, but putting in a condition, that ſo many as will be ſaued by Chriſt, repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and obey him: the which being publiſhed by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as ſoone as the elect heare, they receiue, and ſo know infallibly they are pardoned. And if any man would moleſt them, as the Papiſts for example do, becauſe their name is not expreſly written in the Creed, they might deſpiſe them, and both againſt theirs and the diuels accuſations ſecurely conclude their ſaluation from the condition expreſſed, thus: He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth and forſaketh his ſinnes, and beleeueth and obeyeth the Goſpell vnfainedly, ſhall be ſaued: But I repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake my ſinnes, I beleeue and obey vnfainedly: Therefore I ſhal be ſaued. The firſt propoſition is expreſly contained in the Scripture: the ſecond is the perpetuall and conſtant teſtimonie of the conſcience in ſuch as are called.<note n="*" place="margin">The Schoolmen confeſſe, they are concluſions of faith, which ariſe from two premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the one wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is immediatly reuealed in the Scripture, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dedu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> The concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt needs be true and cannot deceiue, becauſe it is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the word of God, and perfected by the worke of his owne ſpirit in the conſcience, where all the generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the law and Goſpel are applied. If the ſecond propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be falſe, as it is in all that abide in their wicked life, and impenitencie and infidelitie; there is no way but to amend and vſe the meanes of reformation, vntill the conſcience may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out error aſſume it. This concluſion thus grounded, is that faith that we meane, when we ſay, we are iuſtified by faith: and it is ſo farre from giuing libertie to ſinne, and excluding a good life, that you ſee a good life and the promiſe made thereunto, are the premiſes that beget it, yea of abſolute neceſſitie they muſt reform themſelues afore they haue it, and perſeuere in all good workes if they will maintaine it.</p>
               <p n="40">40 The third terme is Onely: whereby the meaning is not to debarre repentance and good workes, but to exclude them from being either the righteouſneſſe that maketh vs accepted
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1857:154"/> to eternall life, or the meanes whereby that righteouſneſſe is applied to vs: though they haue their vſe and abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie otherwiſe; repentance in preparing and making vs fit to be iuſtified by faith, and afterward the ſame with good workes, in the life of man. For the elect are brought to glorie not by iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication alone, but by vocation and ſanctification alſo. In the former we ſay, our workes haue no roome at all, in as much as it ſtandeth in the clearing of a ſinner from the law, and the making of him perfectly iuſt in the ſight of Gods iudgement, which no mans works can do, but only the obedience of Chriſt communicated to vs by faith. In the two other they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe it is the ordinance of God, that if any man come and be in Chriſt, he ſhould repent and be a new creature, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit. Neither when we ſay, faith onely, do we thinke that the faith whereby we are iuſtified is alone, and without loue and works, any more then he that ſaith, the heate onely of the fire burneth, meaneth thereby that the heate is without light: but we hold that iuſtifying faith is alway accompanied with workes, as the Sunne is with his light, and trees with their fruite, and cauſes with their effects; though the workes themſelues iuſtifie not, but being the effects of iuſtification, haue their proper vſe to ſanctifie vs, which is a condition in his due time and order ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to ſaue vs as well as iuſtification, becauſe as I ſaid, God bringeth no man to glory by iuſtifying him alone, but by ſanctifying him alſo: for whom he electeth, them he calleth, and iuſtifieth and ſanctifieth both.</p>
               <p n="41">41 And this is it we meane by ſaying our ſinnes are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, or we are iuſtified by faith onely: whereat as often as our aduerſaries wonder, they ſhould be put in mind of that which Eraſmus told them long ſince, <hi>This word Only, which now adayes they ſhout at ſo in Luther, is reuerently heard and read in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Fathers.</hi> For Saint Ambroſe<note n="t" place="margin">Comment. 1.

               <p n="45">45 Whereby it is plaine, that whatſoeuer we hold againſt freewill, yet do we not lay the bondage thereof on Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, but vpon Adams fall, <hi>which is the proper roote and foundation whence that impotencie that is in our will ariſeth.</hi> For the decree and prouidence of God began not after Adams fall, but before, and yet we thinke Adams will was perfectly free: which ſheweth our opinion to be, that freewill (though we want it) may well ſtand with Gods predeſtination, becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in his innocency had it, &amp; yet was ruled by Gods prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. And therfore our aduerſaries bely vs, when they ſay, our opinion touching predeſtination maketh vs deny freewill: for we thinke indeed our will is moued effectually by Gods will in all our actions; which being the moſt effectuall and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall cauſe of all things, qualifieth our will, and inclineth it to the action; yet doth it not follow hereupon, that therefore we thinke our owne will hath no freedome, but onely that the freedome thereof dependeth vpon a former freedome, which is the freedome of Gods will. And if we hold further, as ſome Diuines do, that Gods will determineth ours, and his decree floweth into all the effects of our will, ſo that we do nothing
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1857:157"/> but as he directeth our will and purpoſe: yet this excludeth not our owne freedome, neither maketh God the author of ſinne, nor implieth any ineuitable neceſſity in our doing. The reaſon is, becauſe God moueth not our will violently, nor inforceth it, but leaueth our inward motiue within our ſelues that ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it vp, which is the act of our vnderſtanding, whereby we iudge the thing good or euill, that we will or nill. For in the proceeding of our will, firſt the minde apprehendeth ſome obiect and offereth it to the will, then vpon the full and perfect iudgement of the vnderſtanding the liberty of the will concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or going therewithall, the will followeth or refuſeth it, as the vnderſtanding iudgeth it good or bad. And <hi>ſo this act or iudgement of our vnderſtanding, is the roote from whence the free choice of our will ariſeth, in ſuch manner as whatſoeuer it be that goeth before the act of our will, or ſetteth in with it, to incline it,</hi> (as Gods will doth) as long as it deſtroyeth not, or inforceth this practicall iudgement of reaſon, the liberty of our will is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. And herein ſtandeth the true<note n="*" place="margin">Concordia liberi arb. cum diuina praedeſt.</note> concord betweene Gods predeſtination and mans will: that the free and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counſell of Gods will, goeth indeed in order before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our will, or at leaſt together with it, and determineth and circumſcribeth it: but forſomuch as it neither inforceth our will, nor taketh away our iudgement, but permitteth it freely to leade and perſwade the will, it expelleth not our liberty, but rather cheriſheth and vpholdeth it: <hi>For whereſoeuer theſe two concurre, freedome from violence and neceſſitie, and the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of reaſon, there is the whole and true reaſon of libertie.</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1857:160"/> either touching that freedome which man had before his fall, in the ſtate of innocencie; or touching that which remaineth with vs now in the ſtate of corruption. Concerning that which man had before his fal, there is no queſtion but he had a perfect freewil both to good and euill, the which was naturall to him, and giuen him with his creation: by the ſtrength whereof <hi>he had power in himſelfe to perſeuere in grace, becauſe the grace whereby he might perſeuere, was in the power of his will.</hi> Onely he was created mutable, that is, ſuch as albeit he were euery way perfect, yet he might fall from that perfection if he would: and he needed the generall helpe of God to preſerue his nature, and to moue him to his actions, the which he had from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his creation to his fall: neither of which impaired the libertie of his will, but rather perfected it. In this matter there lieth no queſtion: for it is<note n="a" place="margin">Tho. 1.2. q. 109 ar. 2. ad 1. Arim. 2. d. 29. art. 1.</note> a Schoole point, that man before his fall needed the influence of Gods grace to moue his wil, which he had.</p>
               <p n="53">53 The queſtion is touching our will now in this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature. And we are all agreed, that the facultie or power of mans mind called the will, is not loſt by his fall, no more then the parts of his body are: but the controuerſie is about the NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE firſt, and then the STRENGTH of it. And touching the nature of our will, we hold two things: firſt, that although A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams will, by nature, was free, as wel in things ſpirituall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, as in things naturall concerning this life; yet ours is not ſo: but in things ſpirituall it is ſtark dead till God create ſpirituall life and libertie in it; and ſo that freedome it hath, is in it by grace and not by nature. By nature we haue power to will naturall things but till grace come there is no facultie to will heauenly things, concerning the ſauing of our ſoule, or once to mind them. This is the firſt point, and the Papiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denie it, ſaying, that will by Adams fall was not extinguiſhed or loſt outright, but onely maimed or weakened, and left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of that which guided it: and the grace of God approching doth onely heale it againe, or as it were waken it out of ſleepe; and they liken it to<note n="b" place="margin">Andr. orth. l. 4 Salm. &amp; Rhem. in Luc. 10.30.</note>

               </p>
               <p n="54">54 The ſecond point touching the nature of freewill, is, that as ſome Diuines thinke, it ſtandeth not in freedome from all neceſſitie, but from all externall conſtraint. For I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, that Gods will ordereth and determineth all wils, from which determination no creature is free: but they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God, and can do nothing but what he pleaſeth: yet for ſo much as this will of God taketh not away the iudgement of our owne reaſon, nor conſtraineth vs, but ſo directeth vs, that we alway in chuſing or refuſing follow the direction alſo of our vnderſtanding; our will hereby is left free; as if a man inuite me to a banket, he is indeed the firſt mouer of my will thereunto, and he leadeth me by the hand towards the place, and in a ſort determineth my will to that houſe rather then to any other; yet for ſo much as I allow of his motion, and finde reaſon in my ſelfe to go, I go freely, and with full libertie, though this freedome is not from all neceſſitie, but from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action onely. And ſo we deſcribe freewill to be <hi>the operation of the will in chuſing or refuſing whatſoeuer the full and perfect
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1857:161"/> iudgement of our vnderſtanding offereth:</hi> which iudgement go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, is ſufficient to make the will free, becauſe where it is, there is no conſtraint. Others contrariwiſe diſpute, our will to be free, not in this reſpect, but becauſe it is ſubordinate to no neceſſitie. For man, ſay they, hath ſuch a ſoueraigne dominion ouer his actions that what he doth, he not only doth vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but he abſolutely may and can do otherwiſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Voluntas a Deo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata, non liberè ſed neceſſariò agit.

But ſuch an abſolute freedom there ſeemeth not to be; for I haue ſhewed before, that Gods will is aboue ours, and ſloweth into it, and moueth it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth it; whereupon it followeth that our will of infallible neceſſitie muſt needs be moued and determined, for Gods wil cannot be in vaine.

               <p n="55">55 This being the nature of our will, the next point to be enquired, is touching the ſtrength thereof, which is not alike in all actions. For the things whereabout the will is occupied are of three ſorts, naturall, ciuill and ſpirituall: naturall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill things concerne this life onely, but ſpirituall things touch the life to come; and therefore mans will hath not a like power in them all. By naturall things we meane ſuch as appertaine to all liuing creatures for their exerciſe and preſeruation, and of their natures, as to eate, drinke, ſleepe, moue themſelues, and ſuch like. By ciuill things we meane all humane actions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſocietie, and the outward gouernment of mans life, which the light of nature and vſe of reaſon leadeth vs to, as ſpeaking, buying, ſelling, going this or that way, the learning and practiſing of a trade or profeſſion; whereunto we alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre morall things, that is, the gouerning of our externall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and members, according to the rules of outward diſcipline, without the inclination or conſent of the conſcience renewed; as the exerciſe of all ciuill vertues, and many externall workes in their kind appertaining to Gods worſhip, to be temperate, bountiful, faithful in word, chaſt, courteous, to ſpeake and heare things good and honeſt, to go to Church:<note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 2.14.

Secondly, this generall concourſe of Gods, helpe being granted,<note n="y" place="margin">Eſa. 26.12. Ier. 10.23.</note> yet we can will none of theſe things perfectly, but in much weakneſſe, and are often hindred, by reaſon our nature through ſinne is depraued, whereupon the mind is obſcured with error, the iudgement corrupted with blindneſſe, the affections diſturbed,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1857:162"/> the will diſtracted, and the reaſon hindered by Satan and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine obiects. Thirdly in the ſmalleſt things that are, and wherein our libertie is greateſt,<note n="z" place="margin">Mat. 10.29.

               <p n="56">56 But in ſpirituall things concerning the ſaluation of our ſoules, the caſe is otherwiſe: for the manifeſting whereof, we muſt conſider that there are two ſtates or degrees of our life. The firſt is called the ſtate of ſin, containing that part of our life which is before regeneration and iuſtification: in which ſtate they are which are not iuſtified till God call them; and then they enter into the ſecond degree, called the ſtate of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then the grace of God freeth them from the bondage of their former corruption. Now the queſtion is, what power mans will hath in ſpirituall things, ſo long as he abideth in the ſtate of ſinne? and whether by the ſtrength of his owne will onely, without faith and the ſpeciall helpe of God, he be able to yeeld obedience to Gods law, or to do any thing auaileable to the pleaſing of God and the ſauing of his ſoule? We anſwer negatiuely, that he is not: becauſe<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.

And although God call none thereunto but by meanes and ſecondary cauſes, yet theſe cauſes are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward light of the ſpirit, and the outward preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; the wil of man being meerly paſſiue in the firſt act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion.</p>

But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he wiſely foreſaw, that if we fell to comparing the liues of one another, his owne Church would receiue as much diſgrace thereby as ours, and his argument bent againſt vs, in the diſcharge would recoile vpon himſelfe, and roll in the fall vpon the heads of his owne people, becauſe they are as bad and ſinfull as their fellowes: therefore now he anſwereth that difficultie, by aſſigning a difference betweene the people of his Church and the people of ours in this point: and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he ſaith, is this, that although in his Romane Church there be <hi>ſome</hi> bad and ſinfull, yet <hi>all</hi> are not ſo; whereas with vs there are none good, but all are wicked. A proud and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous bragge; but yet I anſwer it. True holineſſe conſiſteth in the concourſe of the righteouſneſſe of iuſtification and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The former of iuſtification is whereſouer Chriſt with all his merits, is imputed, and apprehended by faith, for the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1857:168"/> pardon of our ſinnes, and accepting of vs againe to eternall life.<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 4.11. &amp; 3.24.</note> This is called the righteouſnes of faith, and they which haue it are truly holy thereby, and our Church teacheth it againſt the Church of Rome that hath renounced it, and ſo depriued her children of all true holineſſe. The ſecond of ſanctification, is when we bring forth fruites worthy of amendment of life, not walking after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. And we affirme, that in our Church this alſo is ioyned with the former, though we all confeſſe it be in great weakneſſe, and farre from that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which we deſire: and ſuch as walke in it<note n="b" place="margin">1.

For this <hi>morall holineſſe</hi> is no holineſſe indeed, neither do we thereby declare the holineſſe of our Church; but ſay, the good workes done among vs proceed from faith and loue, and are directed to the glory of God, according to the rules of ſanctification, and ſo are ſufficient to teſtifie for vs. And we grant, as the Ieſuit requireth, that many great and plauſible workes of moralitie may proceed from <hi>naturall, yea ſinful motiues,</hi> and that therefore there is <hi>no true holineſſe vnleſſe it proceed from charitie, grounded on a pure heart and a good conſcience, and faith vnfained:</hi> but we adde withall, that the workes of our Church proceed from this charitie, and thence receiue their condition of holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And how doth the Ieſuite know the contrary, becauſe he ſaith ſo confidently, the holineſſe found among vs ariſeth not from charitie? What is the ground whereupon he ſaith ſo?

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1857:169"/> good workes proceed from faith and charitie? and by what meanes he will demonſtrate it to me that doubt it? for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and miracle, I am ſure he can ſhew none: becauſe the miracles of his Legend, which is all he can pleade, concerne not him that neuer had them; and yet he thinketh his holineſſe and the holineſſe of his people, is a good marke of the Catholicke Church. It is falſe therefore that he ſaith, <hi>No man by his outward workes without miracle, can be certaine he hath faith or charitie.</hi> For<note n="c" place="margin">1.

               <p n="6">6 To the place of Prou. 20.9.

It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine alſo that all their narration is deuiſed either for gain or error: and it is a iuſt complaint of Ludouicus Viues, touching certaine hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories deuiſed in the Church: who wiſely &amp; grauely reproueth ſuch who thought it a great part of pietie to coine lies for religion, and following ouermuch their affection, to write things, not as the truth, but as their fancie told them; they preſent vs now and then with ſuch Saints, as the Saints themſelues, if they might, would not be.

               <p n="43">§. 43. The ſecond difference is, that the doctrine it ſelfe, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants teach, induceth men to libertie, &amp; conſequently to leud life. Whereas the doctrine of the Romane Church, both expreſly forbiddeth all vice, and preſcribeth lawes and rules, contrarie to libertie and looſeneſſe of life; and laſtly containeth moſt ſoueraigne meanes to incite a man to all perfect vertue and holineſſe of life. As for example, it teacheth, that notwithſtanding the preſcience or predeſtination of God, man hath free will, wherewith, being ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Gods grace, which is readie for all that with humble, deuout, and perſeuerant prayer will aske for it, he may auoid ſinne, and embrace vertue. And it teacheth that Gods commandements be neither impoſſible nor hard, but the yoke of Chriſt is ſweete, and his burden (with the helpe of his grace) light. It teacheth, that as a man may, by grace, auoid ſinne if he will, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily keepe Gods commandements, and by doing good workes liue well: ſo theſe good workes are pleaſant and acceptable vnto God, and ſuch for which God will giue, to all that do perſeuerantly do them, exceeding grace &amp; euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward in heauen. And contrarie, that for neglecting good deeds, or which is worſe, doing ſinfull deeds, God hath prepared intollerable and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:1857:180"/> paines in hell. It preſcribeth men to faſt and to pray, and to vſe other meanes to keepe the fleſh ſubiect to the ſpirit, and the ſpirit to God. It main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth confeſſion of ſinnes to a Prieſt, as commanded by our Sauiour in the Goſpell: which both is a great bridle to withdraw men from vice, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth, and a ſpeciall meanes whereby the Paſtor of the Church, knowing the inward conſcience of their flockes, may better apply fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to their ſpirituall diſeaſes, and preſcribe to euery one fit exerciſes for their practiſe and progreſſe in vertue. Finally the profeſſion of this Church is ſuch, that euen ſimple Proteſtants, when they ſee a Catholicke do any thing amiſſe, will ordinarily ſay, You ſhould not do thus. So that theſe that ſinne in this Church cannot anie way aſcribe their ſinnes to anie defect or peruerſitie of the doctrine of the Church; but muſt needes acknowledge them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from their owne frailtie or malice, contrarie to the teaching of the Church; and ſometime euen againſt their owne conſcience &amp; actuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Wherefore notwithſtanding that there be ſome ſinfull perſons in the Romane Church, yet it may be called Holy, both becauſe the doctrine and profeſſion thereof leadeth of it ſelfe to Holineſſe, and conſequently is Holy; and alſo becauſe there be many holy perſons, or Saints, in it, of which, as of the better, and worthie and principall part, it may well, and is termed Holy: as a tree which hauing ſome branches that haue life, though others be dead, yet of thoſe, as of the better and more reſpected part, is abſolutely ſaid to be aliue, which if we could not outwardly perceiue to haue any branches aliue, we would abſolutely affirme to be dead, and not aliue.</p>

Stapletons<note n="c" place="margin">De iuſtifie. pag 334.</note> words are theſe: <hi>Euen the Proteſtant themſelues, albeit they diſtinguiſh ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and new obedience from our formall righteouſneſſe whereby we are iuſtified, that it ſhould be no eſſentiall part thereof, yet they teach that it muſt certainly and infallibly be preſent to all Gods children, as an inſeparable companion of iuſtifying faith, &amp; as the proper note of Gods children.</hi> Let the Ieſuite looke vpon this, and bridle the libertie of his tongue. For can the teaching of ſanctification and obedience induce men to liberty and lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? yea when it is required to be preſent certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to all that will be counted the children of God? And whereas notwithſtanding they reply, that the conſequence of our doctrine leadeth men to libertie: I demand, how can the conſequence of this point do it, which Stapleton acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth we teach, concerning ſanctification? for it bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all their life to auoid ſin vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> paine of conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. Whence it followeth, that neither can the conſequence of any other point we teach, do it, or intend it of it owne nature, becauſe the force and reaſon of this floweth into them all. But if any man will peruert that we teach, as<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 5.17.</note> our bleſſed Sauiour and his<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 6.1. &amp; 15.</note> Apoſtles teaching was peruerted in the like caſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with the left hand what we offer with the right,<note n="f" place="margin">Apoc. 22.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Let him that is filthie be more filthie,</hi> and let ſuch libertines and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe aduerſaries go together: for Gods truth muſt not be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as the Church of Rome hath ſhaped it, to qualifie ſuch humors. It is ſufficient that our doctrine in it ſelf, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thereof, containe obedience and debarre the contrary, which it doth; as I haue demonſtrated in all the points that this Ieſuite excepted againſt, in the fortieth ſection: and yet further will do.</p>
               <p n="3">3 For it is vntrue that this Ieſuite ſaith, The doctrine of his Romane Church is againſt all vice, and that no mans ſinnes can be aſcribed to it: for euen the points which he reckoneth, freewill, ableneſſe to keepe the law, the merit of mens works,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:1857:181"/> faſting, praying, and ſhriuing, as the Church of Rome teacheth them, are ſo many hereſies, and directly leade men to ſinne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring them with pride of their owne works, and filling them with hypocriſie, idolatrie, and ſenſualitie: as I haue ſhewed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in them all, in the digreſſions vnder the 40. ſection: whereas being rightly vnderſtood and practiſed, they are the doctrine of our Church alſo, as I haue ſhewed before. And for confeſſion, we thinke it lawfull for any man (excluding the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of neceſſitie) to reueale his ſecret ſinne to his Paſtor, that ſo he may receiue particular inſtruction, when his conſcience is troubled therewith; ſo the ſame be done wiſely and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And that which he addeth touching the ſaying of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, when they ſee a Papiſt do amiſſe, <hi>You ſhould not do thus:</hi> is a weake proofe that we think Popery directeth them to no euill. For we ſpeake to them, either as to hypocrites going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their proud profeſſion, or as to ignorant perſons tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing Gods law. And our words with this relation, are ſo far from ſhewing that we thinke they do againſt their religion, that they proue, we thinke the contrary. For ſaying, You ſhould not do thus, we ſhew them their hypocriſie in taking vpon them a profeſſion that hath no power in it to reforme their liues, and therefore aduiſe them to imbrace the truth that may direct them better. I would not haue mentioned this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is ſo contemptible, but that I perceiue they are inamoured of it. For Campian, in<note n="g" place="margin">Concertat.

               <p n="4">4 The concluſion therefore, that the Romane Church is the holy Church, becauſe the doctrine thereof is holy, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to holineſſe, and the holy Saints are in it, &amp;c. is denied, becauſe the reaſons whereupon it is grounded are falſe, and haue failed in the triall.

               <p n="1">1 That our Church came vp <hi>of late,</hi> the Ieſuite ſaith, but <hi>ſheweth</hi> not: as the Iewes<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh 8.57.</note> ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art not yet fiftie yeares old, and haſt thou ſeene Abraham?</hi> And<note n="b" place="margin">Nunc dogma nobis Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num naſcitur, poſt euolutos mille demum conſules. Prud. Periſtep. hym. 10.</note> the Gentiles to the Chriſtians, that <hi>Now after I know not how many thouſand yeares, their religion was ſprong vp.</hi> But againſt his ſpeech I reply two things. Firſt, that our faith is in all points the ſame that is contained in the Scripture, and ſo conſequently of the ſame antiquitie; and therfore all they that ſay, it came vp but of late, ſhould firſt proue it contrary to the word of God, or elſe hold their peace. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, as it agreeth with the Scriptures, ſo hath it had in all ages thoſe which haue profeſſed it, as I haue ſhewed<note n="c" place="margin">Sect. 17. digr. 17.</note> already, and more diſtinctly will ſhew in the fiftieth ſection. In the meane time let it ſuffice for this place which our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries themſelues vnawares haue written. The firſt is Briſto, who<note n="d" place="margin">Mot. pref. &amp; mot. 45.</note> ſaith, <hi>The truth is, that ſome there haue bene in many ages, in ſome points, of the Proteſtants opinion: in ſo much that ſcarce any peece, or article, there is of our whole faith, but by one or other, firſt or laſt, it hath bene called in queſtion: and that with ſuch liking for the time, that they haue all in a manner, drawne after them great heards of followers.</hi> I know Briſto meaneth they were hereticks that in all ages did this, but that can he neuer proue: yet in the meane time belike he ſaw ſome that were of the Proteſtants faith before of late. The ſecond is Reynerius that liued three hundred yeares ago, who diſcourſing of the Waldenſes, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſubſtance, of the Proteſtants religion,<note n="e" place="margin">Refert Illy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. catal. tom. 2. p. 543.</note> ſaith, <hi>They are in all the cities of Lombardy and Prouince, and other countries and kingdomes. They haue many followers, and diſpute publickely; we haue numbred fortie Churches of theirs, and ten ſchooles in Pariſh.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:1857:184"/> No ſect hath continued ſo long: ſome ſay it hath bene ſince the time of Sylueſter, ſome ſince the Apoſtles; and there is almoſt no country wherein it ſpreadeth not. They haue great ſhew of pietie, liuing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly before men, and beleeuing all things aright concerning God, and all the articles in the Creed: onely they hate and blaſpheme the Church of Rome. &amp;c.</hi> In this teſtimonie of Reynerius, you may ſee our Church was Catholicke both in place, and perſons, and time, and doctrine: and that the Church of Rome was reſiſted, and the religion thereof refuſed afore Luther. The true cauſe why it was not ſo frequent and publicke as now it is, either in place or perſons, was the perſecution of the Pope, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall corruption of the Papacie, which as a leproſie infected, and as a miſt obſcured welnigh all places and perſons, that ſometimes not the true beleeuers themſelues (ſuch I meane as are come to our knowledge) were void of error in euery point, though they firmly held the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as theſe Waldenſes did. And if it pleaſed God in proceſſe of time to giue more libertie to the perſons, and more puritie to the doctrine, what iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is this to ſay, we are not all one Church, when the true faith of Chriſt is not alwayes alike viſibly and purely profeſſed? Minutius Felix<note n="f" place="margin">Octau. pa. 401.</note> ſaith, <hi>Why are we vnthankfull? and why enuie we if the truth of God hath grown ripe in our age? let vs enioy our good, and let ſuperſtition be bridled, and wickednes expiated, and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion maintained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The next point, that our Church is but in few places of Chriſtendome, is both falſe and impertinent. Firſt impertinent: for if it were ſo, yet were it no hindrance to the note of vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalitie. For Gods Church vnder the law, was ſhut vp within the narrow bounds of Iudaea, and<note n="g" place="margin">Digr. 17. nu. 31</note> the Papiſts ſay, theirs (in the dayes of their ſuppoſed Antichriſt) ſhall be <hi>openly ſeene but in few places,</hi> and<note n="h" place="margin">Dried. dogm. eccl. l. 4. c. 2 par. 2. Bellar. not. eccl. c. 7.</note> confeſſe, <hi>it is not required to the vniuerſalitie of the Church, that of neceſſitie there be at all times in euery countrey ſome beleeuers: it ſufficeth if there be ſucceſſiuely. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that if only one prouince did retaine the true faith, yet ſhould it truly and properly be called the Catholicke Church, as long as it might be ſhewed that it were the ſame which it was at other times in other places of the world:</hi> the which we can ſhew of our
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:1857:185"/> Church, how ſmall ſoeuer the compaſſe thereof may fall out to be at ſome time. Next it is falſe: for there is no place in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, but there are ſome of our religion therein, as not onely experience, but our aduerſaries owne reports beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein they<note n="i" place="margin">Boz. ſign. eccl. l. 19. c. 1.

               <p n="3">3 The third point, that our Church is not Catholick in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine neither, is as ill proued as the former. For negatiue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo farre as it is euil, ſtandeth not in denying ſome points which the fathers held, but in <hi>denying</hi> that which they held ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, and which they taught and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be certain and neceſſary matter of faith deliuered in the Scriptures: wherein neither we nor the Centuries euer refuſed them. Neither haue we denied any one point which they held in all ages for the truth, as our aduerſaries haue. For though the Centuries reiect this and that, which the Fathers held, yet they deny neither this nor that, which was holden for the truth in <hi>all ages,</hi> as appeareth by their hiſtorie, wherein they ſhew the ſucceſſion of our faith in all ages, and note how it was many times corrupted and miſtaken, euen by ſome of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; which is all for ſubſtance, that the Magdeburgenſes can be charged with: wherein they haue neither denied the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Catholicke Church, nor offered the Fathers any wrong, to ſay, they had ſome errors, as all men haue, and themſelues confeſſe, which gaue occaſion to others to erre likewiſe: which errors the Centuries ſometimes more then was cauſe noting, they did not thereby notwithſtanding accuſe the whole Church of error, becauſe euery thing was not the Churches doctrine that ſome particular men therein held: and what they noted of ſome particular Fathers, muſt not be ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to be meant againſt them all; as their cenſuring ſomtimes ouermuch of many together, for ſome things written againſt
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:1857:185"/> the truth, muſt not be expounded to be the deniall of all they held beſide: for if it be, and the Centuries be thus cenſured, let this Ieſuite ſay directly without ſhrinking, why doth<note n="k" place="margin">Cathar. tract. de concep. virg.

               <p n="4">4 But this is a point that muſt be further looked into, and not ſuffered to paſſe away thus.

               <p n="5">5 But firſt it is to be noted, that of all hands it is agreed, the Fathers were not of infallible iudgement, but had their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: ſo they ſay themſelues.

Hence it followeth euidently, that euery thing is not vndoubtedly true, which a father or many fathers haue written, but may with good diſcretion be examined by the Scripture, and if it agree not therewith, it may be reiected. Yea this ought to be ſo without any preiudice to their faith that do it.

In this caſe we pronounce that we muſt rather aſſent to Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and Auſtine.</hi> Wherein he ſpeaketh abſurdly, and againſt that which not onely Auſtine and Cyprian, but his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors alſo permit. For you ſee it is agreed, firſt that the fathers may erre, then that many of them may erre together, thirdly that the learned of this preſent time in many things haue more vnderſtanding then they had; and laſtly that therefore with reuerence they may in ſome things be refuſed. Which ſheweth manifeſtly that we hold the truth, and the ſame which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelues practiſe, when we ſay, Luther, or Caluine, or the Centuries are ſometime to be beleeued rather then Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and Auſtine. The reaſon is, becauſe ſometime they haue better meanes to ſee the truth then they had: the which if it be denied, then all libertie and poſſibilitie of diſcerning humane iudgements by the Scripture, is taken away, euen from our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries and all. For if the Papiſts in expounding the text or determining a queſtion, require ſometime to be beleeued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a father, yea many fathers, yea all the fathers (which they very ordinarily do, as I will plainly demonſtrate by and by) why may not we take the ſame libertie?</p>

               <p n="1">1 In the affirmatiue, that is, in matters of faith and godly life, neceſſary to ſaluation, we hold the very ſame that alway was held: but in the negatiue, which denieth many points as falſe &amp; ſuperſtitious, or not certaine of diuine faith, &amp; neceſſary to ſaluation, we confeſſe we cannot ſhew a perpetuall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And the reaſon is, becauſe the things that we deny came in by degrees in later times one after another; and were not held anciently as matters of faith needfull to ſaluation, but were either wholy vnknowne, or at the moſt, the fathers deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered them onely as probable opinions and humane conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. The which diſtinction being laid, my mind is, that it be vnderſtood in all my anſwers to this obiection throughout this booke.

And therefore I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it fully and directly. And touching the time immediatly after Chriſt, and ſo forward til 800. yeares were ended; I name the Primitiue Church and the other Churches throughout the world profeſſing the faith of Chriſt; and affirme that they were of our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though ſome corruptions, eſpecially laterward, came in withall. And if our aduerſaries deny this, we offer to make the triall by the new Teſtament, and writings of all the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:1857:192"/> ſaid ages ſucceſſiuely; out of which we will ſhew, that our faith is the ſame which the Apoſtles preached, and the fathers, for al that time, beleeued: &amp; whatſoeuer came in beſide, was reſiſted and diſallowed; all the difficultie is touching the ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing til Luthers time. And we ſay, that all that time alſo, in euery age ſucceſſiuely, there was a Church of our religion. Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries bid vs ſhew it, and name the place and perſons; whereto I anſwer two things: That touching the place, the Church of Rome it ſelfe was it. For in euery part thereof, there were ſome that held our faith, and that which was called the Church of Rome, was but a contagion outwardly cleauing to it, and by reaſon of the multitude preuailing againſt it, in a ſort, and obſcuring it. Concerning the perſons and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, we lay downe two things: firſt, it muſt needs be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſuch there were, becauſe the names of ſome are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; as for example, the Waldenſes, Wickliffe, and the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, which agreed with vs in the ſubſtance of our religion. Next, we are not bound to ſhew an exact catalogue from time to time preciſely, of euery ſuch perſon and companie, ſo that vnleſſe we do it, we loſe our cauſe: for firſt, it was the time of Antichriſt, wherein the Church muſt be perſecuted, and by that perſecution be diminiſhed and obſcured; which is the cauſe why the profeſſors could not ordinarily poſſeſſe whole cities, and countries wherein they might profeſſe their faith openly, but in all places they liued oppreſſed with the tyrannie, and obſcured with the greatneſſe of Rome, that their names and places, with other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, whereby their memory ſhould haue bene preſerued, could not ſo eaſily come vnto vs. Next it is certaine that the Church may be in places where none can ſee it, as<note n="c" place="margin">2. Reg. 19, 18.</note> in Elias his time there were ſeuen thouſand in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and yet he ſaw neuer a one of them. Whence it followeth that they argue but weakly againſt vs, that ſay our religion was not, becauſe we can ſhew no profeſſors; for Elias could ſhew none, and yet there were ſeuen thouſand. Thirdly, the want of hiſtories is a hinderance. For things paſt can be ſhewed by no other meanes; and the moſt of thoſe times were exceeding bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of good writers. Baronius<note n="d" place="margin">An. 90<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1857:193"/> in the nine hundredth yeare, that therfore it is called <hi>the obſcure age.</hi> So that many things might appeare at thoſe preſent times, which for want of ſtories could neuer come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And the conſideration of this one point may iuſtly ſtay the diſcreete from being too confident againſt vs, when they ſhall ſee many things to be done that are not written to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, but he forgotten. And more then this we aſſure our ſelues, that the Church of Rome would in all thoſe ages do her beſt to deface the memorie of any thing that might witneſſe for vs; whereby it came to paſſe that ſo little was written of the men of our religion. For what they writ themſelues, it was eaſie for their enemies to ſuppreſſe; and what their enemies wrote of them, is of as much credite as that which the Ieſuites write this day of vs. This that I ſay is more then probable. For if at this day our aduerſaries<note n="e" place="margin">Azor. inſtit. tom. 1. l. 8. c. 16. Poſſeu. biblioth ſelect. pa. 130. a.</note> wipe our very names out of bookes, and commaund that no man ſhall <hi>name vs but in contempt,</hi> and charge vs with horrible opinions that we hold not, as that we make <hi>God the author of ſinne,</hi> denie <hi>faſting, praying</hi> and <hi>good workes, &amp;c.</hi> we may with good diſcretion aſſure our ſelues, their anceſtors haue done the like in former ages to the men of our religion. Hence it cometh to paſſe, that their memorie is very ſcant in Popiſh ſtories, as the matters of the Iewes are rarely mentioned in the writings of the Gentiles, though they were famous: and where they are remembred, it is with contempt and ſlander; and hence it is that Wickliffe and the Waldenſes are charged with ſuch vile opinions. For if the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites thus charge and belie vs at this day, why might not their forefathers belie them in like manner, and deface their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?

For is any ſo mad as to beleeue his Popes ſupremacie, his Latine ſeruice, his reall preſence, hath alway bene viſible from the beginning, when there is not ſo much as any mention of them in antiquitie? All that religion therfore which the Romane Church maintaineth againſt vs, came in by peece-meale, through the faction &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance of certaine perſons which in all ages corrupted the truth, and increaſed the corruptions by degrees, till at length

For in the Primitiue Church, and long after, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world indeed communicated with the faith profeſſed in the Romane Church, but then it was not the ſame it is now, and ſo the preſent Church of Rome is not iuſtified by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but condemned rather. Afterward the nations of the world ioyned in profeſſion with it likewiſe, as it degenerated and grew vp in corruption: but marke how.

Maginus<note n="d" place="margin">Geogr. deſcr. pag. 166.</note> ſaith, <hi>The Greekes long ſince departed from the Church of Rome, and appointed themſelues Patriarkes, whom they acknowledge to be their heads: and not onely the Greekes obey them, but all the Prouinces alſo that follow the Greekes religion, Circaſſia, Walachia, Bulgaria, Moſcouia, Ruſſia, the more part of Pole, Mingrelia, Broſina, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania, Illyricum, part of Tartarie, Seruia, Croatia, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces lying vpon the Euxin ſea.</hi> Whereby it is plaine, that many famous countries, and infinite people neuer allowed of the Romane faith, but haue kept poſſeſſion againſt it to this day: though many re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For as much therefore as the Romane Church, by adding and detracting, hath corrupted the vniuerſall doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, and eſpecially the points mentioned by the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, and patched thereunto innumerable abuſes, errors and ſuperſtitions, to the certaine damnation of all that beleeue them; it is not proued Catholicke by teaching all the doctrine of religion, but manifeſtly Antichriſtian, becauſe it teacheth euery point vntruly.</p>

<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1857:198"/> grace vnto their nature, to be a holy ſacrament: though ſtill they remained in their former ſubſtance and property: ſo the humanitie of Chriſt receiued grace by the hypoſtaticall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting it to the Godhead, and yet ſtill retained the former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, to be humane fleſh. And had they beleeued as our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries do touching the ſacrament, they not onely could not thereby haue thus confuted Eutyches, but Eutyches might by that very doctrine moſt probably haue confuted them. For thus he might haue reaſoned: You Theodoret, and Gelaſius and the reſt of your Church, thinke the ſacrament is a reſemblance of the incarnation of Chriſt, and the vnion of his two natures. But in the ſacrament the bread and wine after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration remaine no more, but are turned into the fleſh and blood of Chriſt, and ſo there is but one ſubſtance. Therefore likewiſe in the incarnation, after the vnion, the humanitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more, but is turned into the diuinitie, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is but one: as I ſay. What could they haue anſwered to this reaſon, if they had held tranſubſtantiation? Yea Eutyches made this argument, in part, againſt them. For from the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental change of the ſignes, whereby, of common bread and wine, they were changed to be holy ſignes and inſtruments of Gods grace vnto vs, (which change is it that the fathers men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no other) he could proue a change in Chriſts humane nature: but Theodoret anſwereth him thus; <hi>Now are you catcht in your owne net: for the myſticall ſignes depart not from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but abide ſtill in their former ſubſtance, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſheweth apparently that he beleeued not the tranſubſtantiation</p>

               <p n="1">1 Touching the conuerſion of England by Auſtin the Monk (wherewith our aduerſaries make ſo much ado) I anſwer two things. Firſt, that ſuppoſing he did conuert it, yet was it not to the preſent Romane faith, but to that which was the faith at that time. For neither was Gregorie that ſent him, ſuch a Pope as now the Pope is, inueſted with his ſupremacie, nor his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the chiefe things, ſutable to that which is now hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as may be ſhewed by that which he hath left written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Which being granted, our aduerſaries are neuer the nearer that they ſhoote at, becauſe we can ſhew the ſaid things, ſo brought in, to be errors, and different from that which the Church beleeued long before Auſtins coming. And for triall hereof, let any man ſet downe what Auſtine taught in this his imaginated conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the countrey, and contrarie to our faith, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate it to haue bene againſt the teaching of the Primitiue Church before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, I ſay he conuerted not our countrey at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the planting of ſome trifling ceremonies.

It is<note n="l" place="margin">Alan.

Whereto I anſwer three things: firſt, that if religion were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Brittans, and extinguiſhed no where but in Kent, where Auſtine arriued, then he conuerted not the land, but one poore countrey in it; and muſt be called no longer the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of England, but the Apoſtle of Kent, which compaſſe I thinke our ambitious aduerſaries wil not be content with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is too narrow for their turnes. Next<note n="m" place="margin">Three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. part. 1. c. 11 n. 4</note> the buſieſt aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries that we haue in this matter, ſay, all the land was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about that time. For Auſtine conuerted the kingdomes of Kent &amp; the Eaſt Saxons, and all the reſt were conuerted within
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:1857:202"/> leſſe then threeſcore yeares after, being ſeuen States in all. The which narration aſcribeth the ſame want of the true faith to all the land, that in the obiection is layd to Kent alone. Whence it followeth, that the faith was not extinct in Kent, becauſe it was remaining ſtill in the other ſix kingdoms. The which to be true, appeareth by Bede, who<note n="n" place="margin">L. 1. c. 8.17.21.</note> writeth, that afore Auſtins co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the Brittans were troubled with Arrianiſme and Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme, but Germanus, Lupus and Seuerus, three French Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops deliuered them. Whereby it is plainly proued, that the whole land was not conuerted by Auſtine, but had the faith long before he came. Thirdly, touching Kent it ſelfe, where Auſtine arriued, ouer and beſides that it cannot be proued to haue wanted the faith any more then the reſt of the land did: Bede<note n="o" place="margin">L. 1. c. 25.26.</note> ſaith, that the Queene thereof was a French woman, called Bertha, a good Chriſtian, and had a Chriſtian Biſhop, euen at that time when Auſtine came.<note n="p" place="margin">L. 2. c. 2.</note> And he addeth further, that when he arriued, he found diuers Brittan Biſhops, and learned men, with a Monaſterie at Bangor, all which were Chriſtians, and refuſed Auſtine for his pride, which they found in him contrarie to Chriſts humilitie. And touching the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, our aduerſaries<note n="q" place="margin">Three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. par. 1. c. 9. n. 1.</note> write, that <hi>from king Lucius time vntil the comming of Austine, which was foure hundred yeares and more, they did not alter their faith, but it remained among them when he entred:</hi> for<note n="r" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 17.</note> Bede ſaith, that when a certaine Biſhops ſonne broached the hereſie of Pelagius in the land, yet the people would not receiue it. Which conſtraineth vs to thinke that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine brought not the faith into the land with him, but found it there whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came. His errand (as it may probably be thought) was about the planting of certaine ceremonies, and the dealing with our countreymen about the obſeruation of Eaſter: and<note n="ſ" place="margin">Caſſand. ordo Rom. praefat.</note> Gregory that ſent him, about that time was buſie in changing the Liturgies vſed in theſe Weſtern parts, and did change them, and thruſt his new ones vpon all the places he could. It may be this was a part of the Monkes buſineſſe into Kent.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And as the Ieſuite vntruly aſcribeth the conuerſion of England to the Monke, ſo hath he as abſurdly written, that the Proteſtants religion was <hi>vnhatched</hi> for I know not how many
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:1857:202"/> hundred yeares after. Which he would not haue ſaid, but that Papiſts are famous for their aduentures. For before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,<note n="t" place="margin">Homil. Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic. A Elfrici.</note>

And after the conqueſt liued Iohn Wickliffe, and the Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards, who held the ſame faith that we do, and ſuffered perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for it.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That which he ſaith of other countries conuerted by meanes of ſuch as were <hi>members of the Romane Church,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not Papiſtrie to be either auncient or vniuerſall. For the three firſt authors, in the places alledged, ſpeake of the time within the firſt fiue hundred yeares, when the Church of Rome was of our religion: and that which they report is not of any whom the Biſhop of Rome ſent or procured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the countries, but this,<note n="y" place="margin">Socr. l. 1. c. 19.20. Soz. l. 2 c. 24</note> that Frumentius being ſent by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius the Biſhop of Alexandria, conuerted the Indians,<note n="z" place="margin">Niceph. l. 14. c. 40.</note> and a captiue woman conuerted the Iberians, and a ſort of Iewes in Creet were conuerted by the inhabitants, and the Burgundians inſtructed by a French Biſhop. In all which there is neither mention of the Church of Rome, nor of the preſent faith now profeſſed therein: but our aduerſaries thinke, that whatſoeuer is found in antiquitie concerning the auncient Church of Rome, ſhould belong to them; wherein they finde themſelues deceiued as often as the matter is put to triall, and this one example may ſhew it; for allowing all theſe countries to haue bin conuerted by ſuch as were members of the Church of Rome, yet this was a thouſand years ago, when that Church was the ſame that ours is, and ſo the conuerſions were wrought by perſons adhering to the Proteſtants faith. The three laſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Platina, Eneas, and Baronius, are Papiſts, liuing, one of them, at this day, the other within the memory of our fathers; and therefore I regard not what they writ touching this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, becauſe we haue more auncient records againſt them. And yet whatſoeuer they haue written, the preſent Romane faith is not iuſtified thereby. For hereticks may conuert nations

But miracles or ſignes I heare of none, nor examples of life ſo religious; nay the contrary, I heare of many ſcandals and villanies, and many impieties.

Let them ſhew when the profeſſion of the ancient faith, in anie ſubſtantiall point, did faile in the Romane Church, and when, and by whom, the profeſſion of a new faith began in it, as we can ſhew when and by whom this new faith of others began. Certaine it is, that once the Romane Church had the true faith, and was the true Church, to wit, when S. Paul ſaid to them, <hi>Veſtra fides annuntiatur in vniuerſo orbe. Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Your faith is renowmed in the whole world:</hi> But when (as the learned and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious martyr Campian in Rationibus redditis academicis, ratione ſeptima, vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth) when, I ſay, did Rome change the beliefe and profeſſion of faith, ſo renowmed, which once it had? <hi>Quo tempore, quo Pontifice, qua via, qua vi, quibus incrementis vrbem &amp; orbem religio peruaſit aliena? quas voces, quas tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, quae lamenta progenuit?

Nullus extitit hiſtoricus neque Latinus, neque Graecus, neque remotus, neque citimus, qui rem tantam vel obſcure iaceret in commentarios? At what time? vnderwhat Pope? what way? with what force? with what augmentation or increaſe did a ſtrange religion ouerflow the Citie and the whole world? What ſpeeches? what rumours? what tumults? what troubles? what lamentations, at leaſt, did it breed? Was all the world aſleepe when Rome, Rome I ſay, the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and mother Citie, did coyne new ſacraments, a new ſacrifice, a new doctrin of faith and religion? Was there no hiſtoriographer, neither Latine nor Greeke, neither farre off nor neare, who would at leaſt obſcurely caſt into his commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſuch a matter as this is?</hi> Certainly it is not poſſible that if ſuch a thing had happened, but it ſhould haue bene reſiſted, or at the leaſt recorded by ſome. For ſuppoſe it were true which the Proteſtants imagine, that ſome points of that religion which Rome holdeth at this day were as contrary to that which was in it when S. Paule commended the Romane faith, as white is to blacke, light to darkneſſe; or ſo abſurd as were now adayes Iudaiſme or paganiſme, or as Holinſhead ſaith, it were the bringing them out of Gods bleſſing into the warme Sunne: Holinſh. deſcript. Britan. fol. 11. then I demaund if it were now poſſible that any Prince, in any Chriſtian Citie, much more the Pope in
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:1857:207"/> Rome, the mother Citie, could at this day, bring in any notable abſurd rite, or forme, of Iewiſh or paganiſh religion; for example, to offer vp an Oxe in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or to worſhip a Cow as God; and not to practiſe it priuately in his owne chappel, but to get it publikely preached and practiſed in all Churches; not onely of Rome but of the reſt of the Chriſtian world, and that none ſhould, in Chriſtian zeale, oppoſe themſelues, no Biſhop preach, no Doctor write againſt this horrible innouation of faith, nor the author thereof? That none ſhould haue that Chriſtian conſtancie, which hath bene alway ſeene when any perſecution was, to ſuffer martyrdome, in defence of their ancient faith? That there ſhould be neuer a true heartie Chriſtian that would lament it? None that would ſpeake of it? No hiſtoriographer that would at leaſt make ſome obſcure mention of it? Could all be ſo aſleepe that they could not note it? or ſo cold and negligent of their ſoules good, as generally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care, to yeeld to it? No certainly, though there were no promiſe to the Church of Chriſts continuall preſence, no aſſurance of his holy Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible aſſiſtance, yet it is not poſſible that ſuch a groſſe hereſie could ariſe and ouerwhelme the whole world without ſome reſiſtance. The Biſhops and Paſtors could not be ſo ſimple or ſo vnmindfull of their dutie, but they would firſt note ſuch an euident contrarietie to the ancient and vniuerſally receiued faith; and noting it would, with common conſent, reſiſt, contradict, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally according to S. Paules rule, Gal. 1. accurſe it. If therefore this could not happen, nor neuer did, at anie time in like caſe, that any ſuch groſſe error, or hereſie, did or could ariſe without noting and reſiſting: what reaſon can anie one haue to ſay, that this hath happened at Rome? and yet can bring no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that did note the thing, the time, and perſon, and what oppoſition was made againſt it, as in all hereſies that haue truly ſprong vp of new, we can do. If there could not a little ceremonie be added to the Maſſe, but that it was ſet downe in hiſtorie when, and by whom; how could the whole ſubſtance of the Maſſe, which conſiſteth in conſecration, oblation, conſumption of the ſacred hoaſt be newly inuented, and no mention made when, where, or by whom; or that there was ſuch an inuention at all? If alſo hiſtoriographers were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to note perſonall and priuate vices of Popes, which they might well thinke thoſe Popes would not willingly haue had publiſhed, why ſhould they haue feared to haue recorded anie alteration in religion? which (if it had bin) had bene a thing done by themſelues publikely in the view of the whole world. So that we may well conclude, that if Chriſtian religion had, ſince the Apoſtles time, altered in Rome, it would haue bene recorded in hiſtories, as other ſuch alterations are, and, if they ſhould now happen, would be. But no mention being made in anie ſtorie that ſuch an alteration was, it is ſure no ſuch was at all; no ſuch change of religion being at all, it is euident that the ſame faith and religion which was in S Pauls time, hath alway continued and is there; now that which was there then was the true faith, as appeareth by that high commendation which S. Paul hath left written of it: therefore that which is there now muſt needs be the true Catholicke faith, and that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which profeſſeth it, muſt needs be the true Catholicke Church.</p>

And though the Proteſtants confeſſe their Church to haue bene inuiſible (as I haue expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Digreſſion 17.) yet that will do the Ieſuite no good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we obiect more againſt his Church then ſo: which obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he may eaſily aſſaile with bragges and confidence, but can neuer anſwer with truth and good diuinitie, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Next, he biddeth vs <hi>ſhew when the Romane Church failed in the profeſſion of the ancient faith which once it had, Rom.</hi> 1.8. <hi>and who began the new:</hi> wherto I anſwer, that theſe two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when, and by whom, may be ſhewed in diuers points; which is ſufficient to diſproue all the reſt. See below, nu. 8. <hi>&amp; inde,</hi> where I name both the time and perſons that changed ſome points: which being ſo, there is no reaſon why the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of that religion, the authors whereof are vnknowne, ſhould be iuſtified vnder pretence that we ſhew not the preciſe circumſtances of the alteration; for we giue ſound and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon why we need not do it: and to prepare the Ieſuite and his partakers to the hearing thereof, I propound<note n="a" place="margin">Plutarch.</note> that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous probleme which in times paſt the Greekes debated ſo curiouſly. The ſhip Argos, wherein Iaſon ſailed for the golden fleece, at his returne, the voiage being ended, was laid vp in the road for a monument: where decaying by little and little, they alwaies peeced it anew where it wore away; till in the end the whole ſubſtance of the old veſſell was gone, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained thereof, but onely the reparations ſucceſſiuely made
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:1857:208"/> in the roome of the old. Now the queſtion was this, whether this ſhip (ſay it were Saint Peters, to gratifie the Ieſuite) were the ſame that he ſailed in, when he liued, or another new one, diuers from it? And whether my wiſe Athenian could preciſely tell, when and by what workman euery peece was ſupplied, til the old was wholy gone? for if that could not be ſhewed, then by the Ieſuites reaſon, it muſt be reputed for the very Argoſme wherein Iaſon made his voyage, without any alteration.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But he ſaith, <hi>it is not poſſible that ſo groſſe hereſie,</hi> as we account Papiſtrie to be, <hi>could ariſe and ouerwhelme the world, without ſome reſiſtance: the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church could not be ſo careleſſe,</hi> but they would note and reſiſt it, as the bringing in of any heathen or Iewiſh rite this day into the Church, would be. Whereto I anſwer, that the Ieſuite miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe groſly, if he thinke his faith came in without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or imagine that we grant ſo much. For it was gainſaid in the riſing, with Campians owne circumſtances; the Paſtors of Gods Church oppoſed themſelues, the people lamented, the writers mentioned it, as I plainly ſhew in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. And although the particular circumſtances of Time, Place and Perſons appertaining to this reſiſtance, do not ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently appeare to vs that now liue ſo far off from the change, yet that is by reaſon the ſaid change was not made in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, all at once, but came ſlily and ſlowly in: and we that now liue, haue not records of all that fell out ſo long ago. We haue ſufficient records of many things, but not of all particulars; the want whereof, ariſing either from the ſcarſitie of writers in ſome ages, or the changers tyrannie ſuppreſſing all that was written, is the cauſe why the Ieſuite may the boldlier inſult: Was there no hiſtoriographer that would mention ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? It is one thing therefore to thinke there was no reſiſtance at all, and another to ſay, the particular circumſtances of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances made againſt euery ſeueral point are not now extant. The former we vtterly denie, the latter may be granted; and of neceſſity muſt for theſe conſiderations, namely that a change may haue bene in many points of the Romiſh faith, though we be not able to yeeld the hiſtorie or record of euery particular
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1857:209"/> circumſtance that accompanied it; for firſt we haue no meanes to know what hath bene done formerly but by hiſtories and writings, which we want, or haue in that ſcarſitie, that we may ſafely reſolue our ſelues, many things are wanting that were done. Secondly, we haue pregnant teſtimonie of the change of ſome things, and as ſufficient as we deſire; which is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reaſon that all the reſt was changed alſo, foraſmuch as it ſtandeth all vpon one ground, and one part thereof draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another with it by neceſſarie conſequence. Thirdly it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that all error whatſoeuer conſiſteth in changing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth, yet ſome there be, the particular circumſtances whereof are vnknowne. As for example, The Scribes and Phariſes caught many things againſt the law, and Chriſt reproued them; yet the time when thoſe corruptions firſt came in, and the perſons that deuiſed them, are vnknowne to vs.<note n="b" place="margin">Alphonſ. haer. l. 4. verb. Chriſt. haereſ. 4.</note> In the Primitiue Church there were a kind of hereticks called Acephali, becauſe no man was found to be their head and maiſter. Our aduerſaries ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the reiecting of Images to be a great hereſie: yet can they not tell when it began, nor who firſt brought it in.<note n="c" place="margin">Alphonſ. haer. l. 8. verb. imag.</note> Some thinke Felix Orgelitanus, about the yeare 794.<note n="d" place="margin">Sand. de imag l. 1. c. vlt.

And our aduerſaries cannot deny but themſelues practiſe ſome things in their Church which were not vſed in ancient times, and yet they cannot tell when they began, nor who brought them in. Touching pardons, the caſe is cleare. For Caietan<note n="g" place="margin">Tract. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg. c. 1.</note> ſaith, <hi>There is no certaintie when they began.</hi> And concerning the vſe of Organs in Churches,<note n="h" place="margin">Baron an. 60. nu. 37. Bella de Miſſa. l. 2. c. 15.</note> it is vnknowne when and by whom it came in; ſaue that<note n="i" place="margin">Caiet. 22. q 91. Greg. Val to. 3. pa. 1427. Nauar. de hotis canon. c. 16.</note> the moſt iudicious Papiſts thinke that in the dayes of Thomas Aquinas, which was 1300. yeares after Chriſt, the Church had them not. The which inſtances make plaine demonſtration of that which I haue anſwered, that there maybe a change when the circumſtances of time, place and perſons are vnknowne to vs that liue after.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The reaſon of this is yet further to be expounded. For the Romiſh faith came into the Church as ſickneſſe doth into the body, and ruine to a houſe; which appeareth not by and by,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:1857:209"/> at the firſt, but then when it is ripened: for the children of God abiding ſtill in the communion of the Romane Church (which they did, not by allowing the materiall corruptions in faith whereinto ſhe fell, but by embracing that truth and good which ſhe yet retained, and wanting meanes to reforme what was amiſſe) the cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges which ſucceſſiuely ſhe made in the faith, were not ſo eaſily diſcouered, by reaſon there was yet no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeparation, which is the onely and moſt viſible reſiſtance that can be made. I ſay, Gods children in all ages preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themſelues from conſenting to the changes that fell out in the ſubſtance of faith, but they did not alwayes abandon the communion of the Romane Church, which made the change: firſt, becauſe ſhe changed not in an inſtant, but by degrees; and ſo conſequently ſtill held many good things wherewith they communicated. Next, becauſe the tyranny of Rome ſuppreſſed them, ſo that they could not manifeſt abroade to the world their miſlike, whereby it might come to vs; but by force and violence were conſtrained to deuoure their owne ſorow in the ſociety of their aduerſaries. The want of which departure from the Church of Rome, giueth great colour to her innouations. When Arius and Neſtorius, and ſuch like hereticks aroſe, they violently and ſuddenly brake out of the Church, and forſooke all communion: and when Mahomet came from without, he viſibly aſſaulted the whole Church: this their ſudden violence and ſeparation, made them eaſily knowne to all the world: but the Papacie breeding as a gangrene in the Church within, and corrupting the pure doctrine but by little and little, was not ſo eaſily marked and diſcerned, that it could ſo ſolemnly be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and regiſtred, till it were ripened, and Gods true Church mingled therewith, had meanes to diſcouer it. So we reade in<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 13.25.</note> the parable of our Sauiour, how <hi>the tares were ſowne among the wheate:</hi> but <hi>who</hi> the man was that ſew them, and <hi>when,</hi> did not appeare. The partie, whoſoeuer he were, did it when the labourers were aſleepe, and ſo went his way: the tares he left behind him, but himſelf was not ſeene: and when the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was told of it, he ſtood not diſputing the matter as the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite doth here, with <hi>quo tempore? quo Pontifice? qua via? qua vi?
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1857:210"/> quibus incrementis? Were the workmen all aſleepe? were they all ſo cold and negligent?</hi> For by this argument the tares might haue bin proued to be good corne: but it was ſufficient for him to eſpie them when he came into the field, and to diſcerne them from the wheate, and to giue charge to his ſeruants, that they ſhould not bind them vp therwith. And thus came the change of religion into the church of Rome as theſe tares were ſowne in the husbandmans field.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Thus I haue ſufficiently ſhewed, that forſomuch as we finde the Romiſh faith to be againſt the Scriptures, we haue iuſtly condemned it as hereſie againſt the Catholicke faith; though we were not able to note any time when it began, or perſon that firſt deliuered it, or people that reſiſted it. But we haue another iſſue with our aduerſaries about the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: wherein the Ieſuite, you ſee, with much confidence aſſumeth it, that there can be no proofe made of any <hi>time</hi> or <hi>perſons</hi> wherein his Church altered the ancient faith. He bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs ſhew <hi>who</hi> brought in the profeſſion of a new faith, and <hi>when</hi> the old failed? He asketh, at <hi>what time? vnder what Pope? what rumors, what lamentations did it breed? what reſiſtance was made againſt it? what hiſtoriographer writ it? did none oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues?</hi> and ſo concludeth, that <hi>no mention being made in any ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that ſuch an alteration was, it is ſure there was no ſuch at all.</hi> In which words, containing the ſumme of all that remaineth in this ſection, he requireth vs to ſhew two points: firſt, when the Church of Rome changed her religion, and who they were therein that brought in a new faith. Next, what reſiſtance was made againſt her when ſhe did ſo. Wherein I am reſolued the Ieſuite ſpeaketh againſt his owne knowledge, onely to ſet a good face on the matter. For is it poſſible he ſhould be ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant as to imagine theſe demaunds cannot be ſatisfied? Such as he is may ſpeake boldly and peremptorily, but they that truſt them wil be deceiued; as I wil plainly ſhew in the two next digreſſions, wherein I will out of ſufficient records make direct proofe; firſt, that the beginning of many principall points of the Romiſh faith may be ſhewed, both concerning the time and the perſons that began them. Secondly, that in all ages the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:1857:210"/> corruptions of that Church haue bene reſiſted as they came in. The ſhewing of which two points will fully anſwer all that is contained in this ſection.</p>

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, in reſpect of the effect of his paſſion, becauſe by the ſacrament we are made partakers of the fruit of his paſſion: and,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as concerning this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maner, it is proper to this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that Chriſt is immolated, or ſacrificed therein.</hi> Theſe reaſons of his, ſhew that he knew no ſuch kind of ſacrifice as the Church of Rome now defendeth, becauſe the celebration of the Euchariſt being, in his opinion, but an <hi>image</hi> of the true ſacrifice of Chriſt, he could think it to be no true ſacrifice vniuocally ſo called, but onely by externall relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſaying again, that Chriſt is ſacrificed therin, by <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we are made partakers of the fruit of his paſſion,</hi> he ſheweth clearly he knew no reall ſacrifice, becauſe we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that euen in Baptiſme alſo, where no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imagins Chriſt to be ſacrificed. They that are acquainted with Thomas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing, wil ſoon perceiue, that had he know nor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch a ſacrifice in the Maſſe as is now conceited, he would haue vttered it in other more effectuall termes, and expreſſed it as fully as the Ieſuites haue done ſince him. And touching the outward forme of the Maſſe, I need ſay no more then Cuſanus the Cardinall hath confeſſed.<note n="g" place="margin">Ep 7. p. 857.</note> He ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles made the ſacrament of the Euchariſt by ſaying the Pater noſter, as Saint Gregory affirmeth: and that diuers formes were vſed before one Scolaſticus came, who compoſed that which at this day our Church vſeth. The which alſo is diuers according to the diuerſitie of places. But we which liue vnder the Church of Rome haue receiued the order of the Maſſe from the Biſhops of Rome themſelues, who ſucceſſiuely haue added thereunto, one after another, and ſo it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a perfect Seruice or liturgie.</hi> This confeſſion is enough
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1857:214"/> to ſhew when many ſubſtantiall points were brought, againſt former antiquitie, into the Maſſe.

               <p n="15">15 I am weary of collecting theſe particulars, albeit the like may be done in many more. And therefore I will ſhew one way whereby any point of Papiſtry whatſoeuer may be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly ſhewed to be an alteration from that which was firſt holden by the true Church, though the particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the change cannot be named: and that is the vncertainty and contradictions among our aduerſaries touching the ſame, and the holding of it at one time in a farre other manner then they do at another: the which is a ſtrong euidence to ſhew that it is but the inuention of mans wit; for were it the old <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke</hi> truth <hi>without alteration,</hi> they could neither remoue, nor contradict it among themſelues no more then they do the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinitie, or incarnation.

But marke how long it was before this opinion was ripe, and what vncertaintie there is among themſelues tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching it. For firſt, there was a time when the Church had no images at all, as I haue ſhewed, Digreſſ. 49. nu. 5. then, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, through the faction of priuate men, they gat in, againſt the minds and good liking of the godly, as appeareth manifeſtly by the 36.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1857:214"/> the fact of Epiphanius.

They may ſhew cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pictures and paintings in wals and windowes for other purpoſes; and they may muſter vp the fables of Chriſts and his mothers picture made by Saint Luke, the image that Chriſt ſent to Abgarus, the image erected by the woman of Syrophae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſſa, the image made by Nicodemus, and ſuch like which are either vntrue or impertinent: but one ſolid authoritie cannot be giuen againſt that which I haue ſaid: our aduerſaries haue long ſearched to finde it, and haue wearied themſelues with contending about it, but whatſoeuer they bring proueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when it cometh to the ſcanning.

               <p n="40">40 And touching the catalogue that I haue ſet downe, I warne the Reader of two things:<note place="margin">Note.</note> firſt, that I haue not ſet downe all, either that liued or are recorded in the ſeuerall ages nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; but onely ſome few for example, to anſwer the Ieſuites demaund: by which few you may eaſily gather there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, when ſo learned men neuer vſe to want partakers, howſoeuer the tyrannie and oppreſſion of their aduerſe part may keepe them vnder. Next, my meaning is not to iuſtifie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one that I haue named to haue bene free from error, and a ful Proteſtant in euery point, (though many were ſo in euery point fundamentall) but onely to ſhew that the Papacie in all ages was reſiſted as it came forward, which the Ieſuite denieth. If it be replied, that theſe perſons were hereticks condemned by the Church; I anſwer, firſt the Ieſuite biddeth vs name, <hi>who
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:1857:222"/> reſiſted</hi> Rome, <hi>were all aſleepe, none to obſerue the change? &amp;c.</hi> and I name theſe; whereunto it is no ſufficient anſwer to ſay, they were heretickes, becauſe it vpholdeth not the queſtion; and one hereticke may be able to detect another; and the Ieſuite ſhould not make his chalenge ſo broade as to ſay, <hi>No mention is made in any ſtory</hi> of ſuch an alteration. Next, it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that theſe were heretickes. For one part of them is the Greeke Church, another part is ſome ancient Diuines of their owne Church, a third part is ſuch as the Romane Church per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. The ſecond are ſound and lawfull witneſſes, being the true Church of God to this day, though polluted with ſome errors. The ſecond, though Papiſts in many points, yet ſhew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt al exception, thoſe points wherein they were no Papiſts, to haue bene no part of the Catholicke faith, ſo called, in their time; for then they would not haue reſiſted them, but embrace them as they do all the reſt. The third part I grant the Church of Rome then perſecuted, and now calleth hereticks, but that is the queſtion, whether they or their perſecutors were the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of the Church: &amp; this muſt be decided by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely. For our aduerſaries ſay, they are the true Church, and proue it by their antiquitie without reſiſtance: both which we deny, ſhewing the contrary in the precedent catologue, which catologue when they will diſproue againe, by replying, the men contained therein were condemned for heretickes by the Romane Church; who ſeeth not this to be a retiring backe againe to the queſtion, when that is brought to maintaine the queſtion which is the queſtion it ſelfe?</p>
               <p n="51">§. 51. Neither do I ſee what anſwer can with probabilitie be forged againſt this reaſon. For to ſay, that the errors of the Church of Rome crept in by little and litle, and ſo were not eſpied for the littleneſſe of the thing, or for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Paſtors that liued in thoſe dayes, is refuted alreadie. For firſt thoſe matters, which the Proteſtants call errors in the Romane Church, be not ſo little matters, but that leſſe in the like kind are ordinarily recorded in ſtories. Nay ſome of them, in their conceits, (and conſequently if men of old time had bene Proteſtants, they would haue bene ſo alſo in their conceits) as groſſe ſuperſtition as was in paganiſme it ſelfe: namely to adore Chriſt as
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1857:223"/> preſent in the Euchariſt, which Proteſtants hold Really to be but a bare peece of bread: alſo their vſe of Images, which they account to be idolatrie, and ſay, verie ignorantly and maliciouſly, that we adore ſtockes and ſtones as the painims did; the which things could not haue crept in ſo by little and little, but they muſt needs be eſpied. Neither could the Paſtors of anie time be ſo ſimple or ignorant, ſo ſleepie or negligent, but they muſt needs haue ſeene, and ſeeing muſt needs, in ſome ſort, haue reſiſted, as before I ſaid. For, to imagine all the Paſtors of anie one age at once to haue bene in ſuch a deepe Lethargicall ſleepe, that they could not onely not perceiue when the enemie did ouerſow the cockle ſecretly in the hearts of ſome, but alſo when it grew to outward action and publike practiſe, and ſo could not be but moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, (as the cockle ſecretly ſowen, when it grew and brought forth fruite, did appeare and was well knowne and perceiued, Matth. 13.) I ſay, to imagine all the Paſtors to be ſo ſimple and ſleepie not to marke it then, or not to reſiſt it, is rather a dreame of a proud man in his ſleepe, who is apt to thinke all fooles beſides himſelfe, then a iudiciall conceit of a waking man of anie vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, who ought to thinke of things paſſed either according to the verity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in ſtories; or when this faileth, by conſideration of the likelihood of that which he thinketh was done by men of that time, with that which moſt men would now do in the like caſe. Finally, if this were ſo that the Church did vniuerſally erre, <hi>Neglexerit officium Spiritus ſanctus</hi> (as Tertullian ſpeaketh <hi>lib. de praeſcript.</hi> refuting the ſame cauill of heretickes) the holy Ghoſt ſhould haue neglected his office, which is, as we haue out of Scripture, not to permit the vniuerſall Church to fall into anie errour, but to ſuggeſt all things that Chriſt ſaid vnto it, and to teach it all truth.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The Ieſuite hath ſaid, that if <hi>religion had altered in Rome ſince the Apoſtles time, it would haue bene recorded in ſome ſtory, that ſuch an alteration was: But there is no mention in any ſtory of any ſuch alteration. Therefore it is ſure no ſuch was at all.</hi> In which argument I haue ſhewed both Propoſitions to be falſe, in my anſwer to it in the whole former ſection. But the Ieſuite ſuppoſeth onely two things can be obiected againſt it: either that the errors as they grew were ſmall, coming in by litle and litle, and ſo were not eſpied for their ſmalneſſe; or elſe that the Paſtors, which ſhould haue eſpied them, were all aſleep, which he ſaith could not be. Whereunto I anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And firſt to his laſt exception. For I grant the Paſtors,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1857:223"/> nor people neither, were not all aſleepe, but waking, and ſaw the corruptions, at leaſt when they came to <hi>publicke practiſe,</hi> as I haue ſhewed by induction of al ages, in the former ſection. Onely we ſay, the number both of Paſtors and people decaied daily through the Popes tyranny, that, after eight hundred yeares were expired, increaſed exceedingly, and oppreſſed the true ſeruants of Chriſt. Which oppreſſion vſed againſt the Saints, ioyned with his ſtrong deluſions, and the multitude ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced thereby, cauſed that the warning they gaue could not be heard, and what was heard could not be credited, and what was heard and credited, could not, the one halfe, come to our eares that liue now ſo long after them. It is one thing therfore to ſay: the Paſtors were aſleepe and ſaw it not, when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my firſt meditated and deuiſed the point of Papiſtry that was ſowen; and another to thinke they were all aſleepe when it grew vp and ſhewed it ſelfe. The former we grant: the later we vtterly deny. Againe, it is one thing to ſay, the <hi>world was aſleepe</hi> when the Paſtors gaue warning, and another thing to hold the <hi>Paſtors were all aſleep</hi> that ſhold giue warning. This later is but the Ieſuites conceit, for we neuer ſaid it: the former is the truth, and he cannot diſproue it. Whence it followeth, that <hi>ſtill the holy Ghoſt performed his office,</hi> and euermore led the Catholicke Church into all truth, and gaue it warning of error, and ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the words of Chriſt vnto it: but the Papacy was not that Church, whoſe children had no eares to heare and receiue the warning.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Next, to the firſt exception: I anſwer, the Ieſuite hath falſified our ſaying; for we do not ſay, the corruptions were not eſpied for the littleneſſe of the things, as if they had bene ſo ſmall that they could not be ſeene; for by that reaſon, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe well obſerueth, the worſhip of the ſacrament and images ſhould be no ſmall matter: but we affirme that theſe great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and all the reſt whatſoeuer, came in firſt one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, not all at once. And ſecondly were broached not in their full perfection at the firſt, but by degrees, as come at the firſt ſight beareth no eare, and plants in the firſt ſpring ſhew neither fruite nor bloſſome, in which ſence we may ſay the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:1857:224"/> corne and fruite came in by little and little. For who dreamt images ſhould haue bene worſhipped, when they were firſt brought in for memory? or who ſuſpected the ſacrament ſhold haue bene adored, when they firſt vſed kneeling at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? Therefore when we ſay, the errors of the Romane Church came in by litle and litle, this is our meaning, and thus our words muſt be expounded. Which is a ſufficient reaſon why ſome things, thus coming in, were, at the firſt, the leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, when no great danger was miſdoubted by their entrance.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But if it were granted that ſome leſſer alteration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in ceremonies and Church-canons, came in vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, or ſome points of doctrine hauing at the firſt no ſhew of euill, yet were it not proued thereby, that the godly then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing &amp; allowing them were of another mind then we. For if our ſelues had then liued and ſeene no more danger enſuing vpon them then they did, we would poſſible haue ſaid as little againſt them as they did. Prayer for the dead, the ſigne of the croſſe, &amp; the opinion of freewill, at the firſt coming in, were ſo farre from being applyed to thoſe vile purpoſes whereto the Church of Rome now bendeth them, that they might endure them, and we refuſe them, and yet be both of one religion.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But why doth the Ieſuite aſſume adoration, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for examples of that which came in without controlle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? was he diſpoſed thus to proſtitute his owne cauſe? was there no example he could make choiſe of but theſe, when the world neuer knew any innouation more famouſly and viſibly noted then theſe?

               <p n="1">1 Our anſwer is, that the ſucceſſion required to make a Church Apoſtolicke, muſt be defined by the doctrine, and not by the place or perſons: that is to ſay, they muſt be reputed the Apoſtles ſucceſſors which beleeue the Apoſtles doctrine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue not this outward ſucceſſion of Paſtors, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly following one another in one place, throughout all ages, as the Ieſuite ſaith, it is in the Romane Church.

                  <hi>Succeſſion in godlineſſe, is properly to be accounted ſucceſſion.

To the ſame effect ſpeaketh his owne<note n="c" place="margin">D. 4.

For Poſſeuine<note n="d" place="margin">Not. verbi Dei. pag. 328. ad interrog. 11.</note> writeth, that the <hi>true Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Apoſtolicke, not onely for the ſucceſſion of Biſhops from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but alſo for the conſanguinitie of doctrine.</hi> And Gregory of Valenza,<note n="e" place="margin">Tom. 3. pag. 141. proprietas 4.</note> telling why the Church is called Apoſtolicke in the Nicene Creed, giueth onely three reaſons: <hi>Firſt, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Apoſtles: next, becauſe by them it was ſpred all ouer the world: thirdly, becauſe it ſtill followeth their faith and authoritie.</hi> Waldenſis<note n="f" place="margin">Tom. 1. do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal. l. 2. art. 2. cap. 18.</note> ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles filled the whole Church with wholſome doctrine: and in that reſpect the whole Catholicke Church is alſo called Apoſtolicke.</hi> By all which it is plaine, that for the being of an Apoſtolicke Church, it is ſufficient if it hold the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles faith, though it want the Ieſuites ſucceſſion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Whence it followeth, that although it were granted, the Romane Church could ſhew a perpetual ſucceſſion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, without interruption from S. Peter (which the Ieſuit ſaith may be ſhewed, but<note n="g" place="margin">See digreſſ.</note> I deny) yet were it not thereby proued
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:1857:227"/> Apoſtolike, vnleſſe theſe Prelates had alſo retained S. Peters doctrine: that the reader may ſee, all other marks of the Church muſt be tried by the doctrine; and that the Ieſuits ſucceſſion, and vnitie, and vniuerſality, proue nothing vnleſſe the true faith concurre therewith.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whence it followeth again, that it is no diſaduantage to the Proteſtant Churches, if holding the Apoſtles doctrine, they want externall ſucceſſion of place &amp; perſons, ſuch as the Ieſuite boaſteth of: becauſe the Apoſtolickneſſe of the Church is not to be defined by it, but whereſoeuer the true faith contained in the Scriptures is profeſſed and embraced, there is the whole and full nature of an Apoſtolicke Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And ſo I anſwer the Ieſuites diſcourſe in particular, that we can deriue our faith from the Apoſtles, and that without interruption, in that to this day it was neuer interrupted, though ſuch as ſucceeded viſibly in biſhops thrones did not alway pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it; it is ſufficient that their malice could neuer extinguiſh it, and the profeſſors and teachers thereof liued in the Romane Church it ſelfe; which, beſide all other teſtimonies, we know by this, that it is the faith of the Scriptures, which cannot be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, but groweth in the middeſt of all her enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5 And touching Luther and Caluin, I anſwer,<note place="margin">Touching the calling of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is ſaid againſt them, dependeth vpon another point, which is, the faith that they taught. For if that were the truth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no doubt they were ſent of God to teach it, &amp; we hearing them, receiued it of them no otherwiſe then Gods faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound to receiue the Goſpell of their Paſtors. And whereas he ſaith, they ſucceeded no Apoſtolick Biſhop, neither had any calling to preach that new faith; I anſwer, that for the externall ſucceſſion, whereof I haue ſpoken, we care not; it is ſufficient that in doctrine they ſucceeded the Apoſtles and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Churches, and thoſe faithfull witneſſes which in all ages ſince embraced the ſame in perſecution, though they ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not in that open manner that was vſed afore hereſie and perſecution grew. And albeit the Romane Church would not heare them, yet had they a lawfull calling. Firſt inwardly from God, who ſtirred them vp, gaue them gifts, directed them by
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:1857:228"/> his ſpirit, and bleſſed their labor: then outwardly in the Church of Rome it ſelfe, where they were created Doctors of Diuinity, and Paſtors to teach the people, as they were baptized: by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof they might lawfully preach afterward that which by the Scriptures they found to be the truth, and did lineally ſucceed the true Paſtors of the Church that liued before them. If it be obiected, that hauing their calling in the Church of Rome, it will follow thereupon, that only the Church of Rome is the true Church; this is eaſily anſwered, by denying the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. For the Church of God and the Papacie were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together, and were both called by one name, the church of Rome, by reaſon that in diuers things that were good and indifferent, they communicated. So that euen in the Papacie many of the things of Gods Church remained, as the Scripture, Baptiſme, and theſe callings; which the Pope and his Clergie occupying, did as pirates that occupie another mans ſhip, and his goods therein: and therefore conferring baptiſme and callings to diuers perſons that afterwards forſooke the Pope, the ſaid perſons notwithſtanding rightly inherited them as the true Churches goods which the Papacie vſurped. And whereas the Ieſuite ſaith, they were not ſent to preach this new faith; I anſwer him, that this new faith, as he ſtyleth it, is the true faith: &amp; therfore euen that ſending which they had, bound them to preach it, though at the firſt it reuealed it not to them, but God did it by meanes of the Scriptures, and faithfull profeſſors, that lay ſecretly hidden in the middeſt of the Papacie; and when they ſaw the truth, they needed no other outward allowance to preach, then that which they had to preach the Goſpell: as the Ieſuite will thinke, that himſelfe being baptized in the Church of England, after the order thereof, with intent that he ſhould alſo profeſſe that faith, yet afterward falling to Papiſtry, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no other baptiſme, but by vertue of it may vſe the libertie of other Chriſtians. The very ſame we ſay of Luther and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins callings; whereby they are freed from the imputations that Cyprian and Optatus lay vpon the Donatiſts. For ſuch as haue no lawfull admiſſion, are <hi>children</hi> indeed <hi>without a father,</hi> and <hi>ſcholers without a maiſter,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops without ſucceſſion,</hi> or what

This ſucceſſion of Prieſts and Biſhops continually from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which we haue and the Proteſtants want, the ancient Fathers did much eſteeme, and vſe as an argument, partly to confound the heretickes of thoſe dayes, partly to confirme themſelues to continue in the Catholicke Church, prouing by the ſucceſſion of Paſtors, ſucceſſion of Apoſtolicall doctrine ſtill to haue continued in the Church.

                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:1857:231"/> yet that will do the Romane Church no good at this day. The reaſon is, becauſe then none had ſucceeded but ſuch as kept the Apoſtles faith: which now is otherwiſe. For many Popes ſince that time haue ſucceeded which haue bene hereticks, as I haue ſhewed, Digreſſ. 28. This difference betweene their times and ours, muſt be diligently obſerued, that the fathers ſpeeches, concerning ſucceſſion, may be rightly vnderſtood, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts arguments grounded on them, may directly be anſwered. For Irenaeus in the place quoted, ſaith, the <hi>Apoſtolicke tradition or doctrine, and faith,</hi> which they preached to men, was come to them by ſucceſſion of Biſhops. Whereby it appeareth, they had not yet diſcouered that apoſtaſie in Biſhops thrones which afterward enſued; but the true faith remained ſtill, which now in the Church of Rome it doth not. Let our aduerſaries therfore bring thoſe times back againe, and reſtore vs the Biſhops that then ſucceeded, and we will allow them the ſame argument of ſucceſſion that the fathers made, or elſe not. For Hegeſippus ſpeaking of that time,<note n="a" place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. l. 4. c. 22.</note> ſaith, that <hi>as the law and the Prophets, and the Lord himſelfe had taught, ſo was it in euery ſucceſſion, and euery citie.</hi> Now it is contrary: as the Friers and Ieſuites, and the Pope himſelfe haue deuiſed, ſo is it in euery ſucceſſion, and euery citie of the Church of Rome. Which is a manifeſt reaſon why the Fathers argument, drawne fom ſucceſſion, cannot benefite the externall ſucceſſion of Popes in that Church at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Againe, they vſed ſucceſſion as an argument to proue their Church, but not in that manner that our aduerſaries vſe it to proue theirs. For firſt the Ieſuit would make vs beleeue, that <hi>by the ſucceſſion of Paſtors, the ſucceſſion of Apoſtolicall doctrine is proued</hi> to continue; yea, he ſaith, that <hi>with outward ſucceſſion of doctors and Paſtors was alway infallibly conioyned the true doctrine.</hi> This the Fathers neuer ſaid, as ſhall appeare in my ſpeciall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their words. Neither would the Ieſuite haue ſaid it him ſelf, if he had remembred the Greek Churches, which haue as lineall ſucceſſion from Saint Mark and Saint Andrew, as Rome hath from Saint Peter, and yet<note n="b" place="margin">Can. loc. l. 4. c. vlt. pag. 143.</note> they are counted heretical. Yea Bellarmine<note n="c" place="margin">Not. eccl. c. 8.</note> ſaith, <hi>It is not neceſſarily gathered that the Church is alway there where there is ſucceſſion;</hi> which ſheweth the Ieſuits
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1857:231"/> raſhnes in his aſſertion. For if the true faith were infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with the outward ſucceſſion, then it would neceſſarily follow, that the true Church is alway there where ſucceſſion is, which Bellarmine denieth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 But with ſucceſſion of perſons, the Fathers alway ioyned ſucceſſion of doctrine, and by them both together confuted ſchiſmaticks. Thus doth Irenaeus in the very words alledged, and<note n="d" place="margin">L. 4. c. 43.</note> in another place more fully: <hi>We muſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>obey thoſe el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which haue ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles, which with the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Biſhopricks, haue receiued the certaine gift of truth: as for the reſt which want this principall ſucceſſion, we muſt ſuspect them.</hi> Marke how he directeth you to embrace that ſucceſſion which holdeth the doctrine alſo, and refuſe that which hath it not: which had bin idle, if the doctrine had bin ſo vnited to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that it could not haue bin without it. Now our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſay otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Secondly, the Fathers inſiſted on the ſucceſſion of other Churches as well as the Church of Rome; which proueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly that the ſucceſſion which they aſſumed, proueth not the Church of Rome to be the Church of God, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not other Churches ſo to be. Our aduerſaries haue<note n="e" place="margin">Poſſeuin. noc. verbi Dei. pag. 329.</note> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that <hi>the ancient Fathers reckoned not vp the ſucceſſors of other Biſhops alike, as they did the ſucceſſors of the Romane chaire:</hi> but this is an vntruth, proceeding of deſperation: for Irenaeus in the chapter alledged, mentioneth the Churches of Smyrna, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Aſia: and in<note n="f" place="margin">L. 1. c. 3.</note> another place, the Churches of Germany, Spaine, France, Egypt, Lybia and others. And Tertullian<note n="g" place="margin">Praeſcript.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth vs to Corinth, Philippi, Theſſalonica, Epheſus &amp; Rome. Whereby it is plaine, that if Rome be now the true Church, becauſe the Fathers mention the ſucceſſion thereof, then the Churches of Greece muſt be granted to be the true Church alſo, becauſe the Fathers mention their ſucceſſion alſo, which in Conſtantinople and Alexandria is preſerued to this day. But in that they reckon vp the ſucceſſion of other Churches as well as of Rome, it appeareth that they thought it was tied no more to Rome then to others.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Out of all this that I haue ſaid, I anſwer to the places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:1857:232"/> And firſt to Irenaeus, that he ſaith not ſimply he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced heretiks by ſhewing ſucceſſion, but by ſhewing <hi>the faith which ſucceſſiuely had continued</hi> to his time: and we are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Ieſuite conuince vs ſo too, if he can. Tertullian biddeth hereticks, if they can, deduce the ſucceſſion of their Churches and ſectmaſters: which he might wel do, although it would not follow thereupon, that whereſoeuer outward ſucceſſion were, there ſhould be alſo true doctrine. And he had reaſon to make them this challenge, for though euery company be not the true Church that hath outward ſucceſſion, yet they pretend themſelues ſo to be; therefore he prouoketh them to put the ſucceſſion in triall, and ſhew if they can that the firſt author of their ſect was an Apoſtles ſucceſſor. This was a good trial then, but now it is not, when not onely new ſeas are erected, but the ſucceſſors in ancient thrones are corrupted. Auſtine ſaith, the ſucceſſion of Biſhops retained him in the Church of Rome. And good reaſon, when they ſucceded in faith as well as in ſea. If he were now aliue, he would ſay otherwiſe, when the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſuch as it is, remaineth without the faith: it was not the ſucceſſion alone that retained him, but other motiues ioyned with it, and mentioned in the ſame place, which now are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. So likewiſe<note n="h" place="margin">Ep. 165.</note> in his epiſtle to Generoſus, he reckoneth vp the Biſhops of Rome that had bin till his time; not vſing their ſucceſſion as an argument to proue it the true Church, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thoſe that had ſucceeded therein, and perſeuered in the truth: which he then well might do, but the Ieſuit now cannot, in as much as the Popes following declined from the faith of their anceſtors. Optatus mentioneth the Romane ſucceſſion as Auſtin doth, reckoning vp a catalogue of the Biſhops that had bin in that ſea till Siritius time, to ſhew the Donatiſts that the Church was in other places as well as in Affrick; and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them that their Churches wanted ſucceſſion alſo, and not the true faith onely. This is no aduantage to the Ieſuites cauſe. For as ſome hereticks want ſucceſſion, ſo all that haue it are not proued thereby to be true Catholicks, for any thing that Auſtin or Optatus ſay. That which Cyprian ſaith, receiueth the ſame anſwer that I haue giuen to the reſt.</p>

Paul himſelfe, Epheſ. 4. who ſaith that our Sauiour <hi>Dedit paſtores &amp; doctores ad conſummationem ſanctorum, in opus miniſterij, in edificationem corporis Chriſti, donec occurramus omnes in vnitatem fidei &amp; agnitionis filij Dei, in virum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum, in menſuram aetatis plenitudinis Chriſti, &amp;c.</hi> Signifying that Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe outward functions of Paſtors in the Church to continue for the edification and perfection thereof vntill the worlds end; eſpecially for this purpoſe, as is ſaid in the ſame place, <hi>vt non ſimus paruidi fluctuantes, &amp; non circumferamur omni vento doctrinae:</hi> that we may not be little ones, wauering and caried away with euery wind of doctrine. Therefore that this ordinance and intention of our Sauiour might haue the purpoſed effect, he muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſo to aſſiſt and direct theſe Paſtours in teaching the true faith, that the people, their flocke may alwayes, by hearing them, be preſerued from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering in the ancient faith, and from error of new doctrine: the which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, vnleſſe with ſucceſſion of the Paſtors lawfully ſucceeding be conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned true doctrine, in ſuch ſort that all true Paſtors ſhall neuer vniuerſally erre, or faile to teach the ancient and Apoſtolicke doctrine. For if they ſhould thus vniuerſally erre, then all the people, who do, and ought like ſheepe, follow the voyce of their Paſtors, ſhould alſo generally wauer and erre from true faith, and be caried about with the wind of new doctrine, contrarie to this purpoſe of almightie God, expreſſed in this place by S.

But this neither confuteth vs, nor iuſtifieth the Church of Rome. It confuteth not vs, becauſe<note n="d" place="margin">§. 52. per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</note> I haue ſhewed the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of our faith do lawfully ſucceed, &amp; ſo alway haue done, though not outwardly, and viſibly to the world. And it iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not the Church of Rome, foraſmuch as the ordinarie Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors therein ſucceed not lawfully. They ſucceed, in a ſort, externally, ſitting in the ſeats where ſometime the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors did: but they ſucceed not lawfully, as I will ſhew in the next ſection, or any other way then the Greecians now do, or then the Phariſes &amp; high Prieſts did in our Sauiors time, when they refuſed him, denying him to be the Sonne of God, &amp; requiring a murtherer to be giuen vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which they could not haue done if the Ieſuites aſſertion were true, that the faith of Gods Church is infallibly conioyned with the outward ſucceſſion. For they had the outward ſucceſſion from Aaron, lineally without interruption; and yet if the people had obeyed them in all things, they had led them into an vniuerſall error, no leſſe then the reiecting of the Sonne of God. Now if onely <hi>lawfull ſucceſſion</hi> haue the truth abiding with it, and that
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1857:233"/> is lawfull which ſucceedeth principally in doctrine, retaining the ancient faith as well as the place and externall ſhew, which our aduerſaries dare not deny, and Tertullian affirmeth,<note n="e" place="margin">Praeſcrip. c 32</note> where he ſaith, the <hi>Churches that conspire with the Apostles in the ſame faith, are reputed no leſſe Apoſtolicall, for the conſanguinitie of the doctrine:</hi> if, I ſay, this lawfull ſucceſſion onely haue the true faith going with it, let them ſay freely, and without collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to what purpoſe ſhould they pleade their externall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to iuſtifie their faith, before they haue pleaded their faith to iuſtifie their ſucceſſion? which when they haue done (and they can do it no way but by the Scripture) the Proteſtants will neuer except againſt their ſucceſſion, but imbrace it. And what vanitie is it to obiect againſt vs that we want outward ſucceſſion, when that ſucceſſion which is to be ſtood vpon, conſiſteth not in the circumſtances of place, and ſhew, but in the retaining of the true faith? which may be done without interruption, when the outward ſhew of places and perſons is interrupted.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Secondly, I anſwer further to the text alledged, and to all his diſcourſe thereupon, granting, firſt, that the miniſterie of Paſtors is the ordinance of God. Secondly, to continue in his Church for euer. Thirdly, for the teaching of his people. Fourthly, in ſuch ſort that they ſhall neuer vniuerſally erre or faile to teach the ancient and Apoſtolicke doctrine. Fiftly, whereupon the people are bound to heare them. And hence it followeth, that ſixtly, where ſuch Paſtors ſucceede, the true faith is alway conioyned. This is granted. But then our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhould conſider, that ſuch Paſtors, furniſhed with theſe promiſes, do not alway ſucceed openly, or in one place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption of the externall ſucceſſion; but they may ariſe and ſucceſſiuely continue when the world ſeeth them not, or ſeeing them, driueth them from the Epiſcopall ſeas, that they ſhal be conſtrained to teach the Church in ſecret. S.

For<note n="g" place="margin">Sur. comment rerum. in orb. geſt. p. 424.</note> they write of their Cardinall Gropper, in praiſe of his continency, that he threw his bed out of his chamber window, becauſe on a time, he found a woman making it.

They that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber how much hath bin caſt of late, ſince printing came in, out of all authors, by ſuch purgation, may with good diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enquire into this point. For the Church of Rome is ſo curious in auoiding ſuſpitions, that if any ſeruant of hers, be it Caietan, or Ferus, or Thomas, or Anaſtaſius himſelfe, make a bed in a wrong chamber, by writing any thing that may iuſtifie the Proteſtants faith, out it ſhall go at the window, and the booke be purged.</p>

               <p n="56">§. 56. And this concluſion I may alſo confirme with the authoritie of the ancient Fathers, who in expreſſe words do affirme, the Romane Church, which was then gouerned by Popes as now it is, to be the lawfull and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke Church; Iren. l 3. c. 3.5.

And that it was not, in their time, thus gouerned, I haue ſhewed, Digreſſion. 27. and 49. num. 6. and 51. num. 9. The Biſhops of Rome in their time, I graunt, were called Popes and Occumenicall, as<note n="a" place="margin">Ep. Arſen. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Athan. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. 2.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Next, albeit they affirme the Church of Rome to be the lawfull and Apoſtolike Church, yet they affirmed not the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> Romane Church, which they neuer ſaw, ſo to be. He that affirmed Lais to be a virgine when ſhe was ten yeares old, did not ſay, ſhe was ſo at twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie. Rome ſince their death hath plaied the whore, and loſt that name and reputation which the fathers had of her. Which anſwereth all the places cited out of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Auſtine, Ambroſe, Hierome, and Cyprian. For, calling Rome the Apoſtolike Church, they ſpake of their owne time, and not of ours.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, they do not affirme the Romane Church in their dayes to be lawfull and Apoſtolike, <hi>for no other reaſon,</hi> but becauſe it had a lineall ſucceſſion from the primitiue Church: but, as I haue anſwered<note n="d" place="margin">Sect. 53. n. 2. &amp; inde.</note> before, becauſe it had withall the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of doctrine, which the preſent Papacie hath not. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they thinke that therefore it had ſucceſſion of doctrine becauſe it had ſucceſſion of Prieſts, as if the former muſt needs be inſeparably ioyned with the later. For their words expreſſe no ſuch thing as I haue ſhewed. They reuoke ſchiſmatickes to the ſucceſſion indeed of the Romane Church, as they did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of others, and obiect it againſt them: but not it alone, nor
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:1857:239"/> ſo as they would aſſume all ſucceſſion, for euer, to be ioyned with the true faith, though then, in the Churches named, it was. Neither did they beleeue the Prieſts whom they ſo called, to be ſacrificers, or Maſſing Prieſts. They vſed the name, but they gaue it not the definition which the Church of Rome now vſeth. Vpon all which it followeth, that the ancient fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not the Romane Church at this day to be the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke Church, though you ſee into the places cited an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times; the which are anſwered Sect. 53. principally for this cauſe, that the reaſons whereupon they ſo commended it then, hold not now in our dayes as they did in theirs. If our aduerſaries will take benefite by that which the fathers ſay in commendation of the Romane Church in their dayes, they muſt proue their ſucceſſion as inuiolated, and their doctrine as ſound as then it was: which they can neuer do.</p>
               <p n="57">§. 57. Now to make an end, conſidering all this which I haue ſaid and proued, to wit, that there is but one infallible and entire faith, the which is neceſſarie to ſaluation to all ſorts of men, the which faith euerie one muſt learne by ſome knowne, infallible, and vniue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſall rule, accommodate to the capacitie of euerie one: the which rule can be no other but the doctrine and teaching of the true Church, which Church is alway to continue viſible to the worlds end, and is to be knowne by theſe foure markes aforeſaid, agreeing onely to the Romane Church; whereupon it followeth that it only is the true Church, of which euery one muſt learne that faith which is neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: conſidering, I ſay, all this. I would demaund of the Proteſtants who will not admit the authoritie or doctrine of the Church, how they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues to haue that faith whereby they may be ſaued? or by what right they can chalenge vnto themſelues the title of the true Church? ſince, as I now haue proued, they haue neuer a one of theſe foure markes, which by the common conſent of all, are the true markes of Chriſts true Church. How can theirs be the true Church which neither is <hi>one,</hi> becauſe it hath no meanes to keepe it in vnitie: nor <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe neither was there euer man of it which by miracle, or by ſome other vndoubted teſtimonie, can be proued to be truly holy? Neither is their doctrine ſuch as thoſe that moſt purely obſerue it, do without faile, become holy; nor <hi>catholike,</hi> becauſe it teacheth not all true things which haue bin held in former times, but denieth many of them. Neither is it ſpread ouer all the Chriſtian world, but euery particular ſect is contained in ſome few corners therof: neither hath it bene euer ſince Chriſt, but ſprong vp of late; the firſt founder being Martin Luther an apoſtata Frier, a man after his apoſtaſie knowne both by his writings, words, and deeds, and
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:1857:239"/> maner of his death, to haue bene a notable euill liuer; nor <hi>Apoſtolike,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the preachers thereof cannot deriue their pedegree lineally without interruption from anie Apoſtle, but are forced to begin their line, if they will haue anie, from Luther or Caluin, or ſome later. How can they then bragge that they only haue the true, holy, Catholike and Apoſtolike faith? Since this is not found but only in the true, holy, Catholike, &amp; Apoſtolike Church; and remaining alwayes, as S Auguſtine ſaid, <hi>in ventre Eccleſiae, in the bellie of the Church.</hi> It is vnpoſsible that they which are not of this Church, ſhould haue the true faith, according to the ſaying of the ſame Auguſtin afore cited <hi>Quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis ab hoc ventre ſeparatus eſt, neceſſe eſt vt falſa loquatur: whoſoeuer is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from this bellie of the Church, he muſt needs ſpeake falſe</hi> For who can once haue true faith, vnleſſe he firſt heare it? becauſe <hi>fides eſt ex auditu.

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p n="1">1 That which the Ieſuite hath ſaid and proued, is granted him, to wit, that there is indeed but one true faith, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to ſaluation to all ſorts of men; the which as it muſt, ſo it may be learned by that rule which God hath left, infallible, vniuerſall and accommodate to the capacitie of euery one: the which rule is the Scriptures, contained in the bookes of the old and new Teſtament, and not that which the Ieſuit meaneth by the doctrine and teaching of the Church: though no man deny but that is needfull for the ſhewing and teaching of the rule to all that ſhall be ſaued, expounding the ſaid teaching of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie wherby the faithfull are directed in the Church. But he hath not proued the Church to be alway viſible to the world, nor thoſe foure to be the Notes of the Church. He hath ſaid it, but not proued it, as appeareth by my anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All which being conſidered, his demands are ſoone and ſhortly anſwered, that the Proteſtants admit the authority and doctrine of the Church, though they thinke not the Papacie to be it, nor the authoritie thereof to be aboue the Scripture. And the grounds wherupon they perſwade themſelues to haue the ſauing faith, are ſo infallible, that all the Papiſts in the world cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute them. And our title to the true Church is ſound, when our aduerſaries haue ſmattered and wrangled againſt it
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:1857:240"/> what they can: for the doctrine of the Scripture which in all points we profeſſe &amp; beleeue, proue it. And albeit thoſe foure, <hi>One, Holy, Catholicke,</hi> and <hi>Apostolicke,</hi> be not the markes of the Church, but certaine qualities therein, yet we haue them, at leaſt for anie thing the Ieſuite hath ſaid to the contrarie: all whoſe diſcourſe againſt vs, pretending the want of theſe things among vs, I haue fully anſwered in their proper places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted vpon himſelfe, whereby the iudicious reader may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. And therefore when we ſay, ours is the true faith, we brag not, but maintaine and auouch our lawfull title, <hi>ſince,</hi> as S. Auſtin ſaith, <hi>the ſame is not to be found but in the bellie of the true Church,</hi> which we are. Whereupon we aduiſe all Papiſts whatſoeuer to renounce the Papacie if they will hold the truth and be ſaued. <hi>For, according to the ſaying of the ſame Auſtin afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cited, whoſoeuer is ſeparated from this bellie of the Church, muſt needs ſpeake falſe, becauſe out of the true Church there is neither true preaching, nor lawfull ſending ſuch as ſhould preach:</hi> and I haue manifeſtly ſhewed that the Papacie is not the true Church, but a diſeaſe, that by the faction of ſome, grew vnto it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thus the whole diſcourſe of this Section is briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. But where he ſaith, <hi>our religion ſprang vp of late, the firſt founder being Martin Luther, an apoſtata Frier, a man knowne by his writings, words, deeds, and death, to haue bene a notable euill liuer:</hi> this muſt be a little more ſtood vpon, becauſe it is the burden of euery ſong among the Papiſts. And firſt, it is to no purpoſe to ſay, our religion ſprang vp of late, in Luther, vnleſſe our euidence whereby we ſhew it to agree with the Scripture, and to haue bene taught, in the Church of Rome it ſelfe, many hundred yeares afore Luther was borne, can be diſproued. Next, we graunt Luther was <hi>a Frier,</hi> and obtaining the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, renounced the profeſſion, which was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>apoſtaſie,</hi> or fault in him, then it was in S. Paule when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the profeſſion of a Phariſee, and became an Apoſtle; both the profeſſions being hypocriſie, ſaue that of the Frier was of a deeper tincture, as I haue ſhewed, Digreſſ. 45. Then concerning <hi>his writings</hi> the Ieſuite is no competent iudge. For woe to him and all his Church, if Luthers writings be good.
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:1857:240"/> And therefore let them be examined by the Scripture, the touchſtone of all mens writings, &amp; not by the witles preiudice of idle companions that neuer read them. And if they containe ſome particular things that deſerue reproofe, yet what diſgrace is that to the ſubſtance of his writings? What fathers writing is ſo pure but it containeth ſome error? Yea <hi>I challenge the Ieſuit, let him name, if he can, one writer of his owne ſide, old or new, Schooleman, or Ieſuite, but ſome or other in the Church of Rome will except againſt ſomething he writ?</hi> Thomas, Caietan, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and Baronius are controlled; yea in the later editions, the Councell of Trent hath purged, in a manner, all writers; which maketh it cleare, that ſome errors in Luthers bookes diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vs no more then the errors purged and eſpied in their owne books, diſaduantage the Papiſts.

And when he had ſaid this he began to ſleepe; but the force of his diſeaſe awakening him, ſomething after midnight, he began to complaine of the ſtopping in his breſt, and to feele death coming vpon him, Whereupon he fell to prayer, vſing theſe words: Heauenly Father, who art God and the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the God of all comfort, I giue thee thanks for that thou haſt reuealed thy Sonne Christ vnto me: in whom I haue beleeued, whom I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, loued, and preached, and whom the Biſhop of Rome, and the reſt of the wicked, perſecute and reproach: I beſeech thee my Lord Ieſus Chriſt receiue my poore ſoule.

And not long after this, he commended his ſoule into the hands of God, two or three times ouer, with ſhew of much comfort: vntill, as a man falling aſleepe, by little and little, he departed this life, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by perceiuing no paine to vexe him.</hi> This was the end of that good man, whoſe memory ſhall be precious in the Church for euer, and there kept greene and floriſhing as the rod of Aaron laid vp in the tabernacle: the ſame time being preſent by him the Earle of Mansfield, and other noble men, Iuſtus Ionas, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Coelius, Ioannes Aurifaber, and many more, who haue teſtified theſe things to be true, and accompanied his body to Wittenberge; where by the appointment of the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, he was honourably buried in the Tower Church, and with great lamentation of many; Bugenhagius making the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermon, and Melancthon the Oration.</p>

And when it was demanded of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, where they had bene? they anſwered, that by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Prince, they were called forth to the funerall of Luther. And this was proued to be true, becauſe a ſeruant of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:1857:242"/> Luthers, that was in the chamber when he died, opening a caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take in the aire, ſaw neare vnto him a great number of blacke ſpirits hopping and dancing. The which is a mery tale, ſaue that it was made betweene the diuell and the exorciſt, and croſſeth the former: for if Luthers ſeruant was in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by him when he died, then he was not ſtrangled ſuddenly by his wife in the night: and if the ſpirits departed out of the poſſeſſed to go to his buriall, then belike he was buried and not left in a ditch.</p>

                  <hi>A horrible miracle, &amp; ſuch as was neuer heard of before, that God who for euer is to be praiſed, in the fowle death of Martin Luther, damned in body and ſoule, ſhewed for the glory of Chriſt, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment and comfort of the godly. When Martin Luther fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his diſeaſe, he deſired the body of our Lord Ieſus to be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him; which hauing receiued, he died ſoone after. And when he ſaw his end approch, he deſired that his bodie might be layd on the altar, and worſhipped with diuine honors. But God willing at the length to make an end of horrible errors, by a huge miracle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the people to deſiſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the impietie that Luther had brought in. For his body being layed in the graue, on the ſudden ſuch a tumult and terror aroſe, as if the foundation of the earth had bene ſhaken. Whereupon they that were preſent at the funerall grew amazed with feare, and lifting vp their eyes ſaw the holy hoaſt hanging in the aire. Wherefore with great deuotion they tooke it, and layed it in a holy place: which being done, this helliſh noiſe was heard no more. The next night after was heard a noiſe and cracking about Luthers tombe, much louder then before, which waked all that were in the citie out of their ſleepe, trembling and almoſt dead for feare. Wherefore in the morning opening the ſepulcher where Luthers deteſtable body was layed, they found neither body, nor bones, nor
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:1857:243"/> clothes, but a ſtinke of brimſtone coming out of the graue, had wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh killed all the ſtanders by. By the which miracle many being terrified, reformed their liues to the honour of the Chriſtian faith and the glory of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This merry conceit being ſpread ouer Italy, at length a copie came to Luthers hands, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing peruſed, he writ theſe words vnder: <hi>I Martin Luther, by this my hand writing confeſſe &amp; teſtifie, that vpon the</hi> 21. <hi>of March I receiued this fiction, concerning my death, as it was full of malice and madnes: and I read it with a glad mind, and a chearful counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but yet deteſted this blaſphemie, whereby a ſtinking lie is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on the diuine maieſtie of God. As concerning the reſt, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reioyce and laugh at the diuels malice, wherewith he and his rout, the Pope and his complices, purſue me. And God conuert them from this diuelliſh malice. But if this my prayer be for the ſinne that is vnto death, that it cannot be heard, then God graunt they may fill vp the meaſure of their ſinne, and with ſuch lying libels as this let them delight themſelues one with another, to the full.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the libell, with Luthers anſwer; whereby it appeareth of how ſhall credit the Papiſts reports are touching Luther, and what the practiſe of the Romane Church is againſt the perſons of all that embrace not her errors: and the Ieſuite is admoniſhed hereby, that Luthers life and death, reported by his enemies, is no indifferent motiue why any man ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Proteſtants religion the more for it. For this report is made the more incredible, becauſe it walked abroade afore he was dead: and the Reader may the eaſilier beleeue that I ſay, becauſe within our owne memory, the like was done by Caluin and Beza, in their life time.</p>
               <p n="9">9 But what needed the Ieſuite labour thus to diſcredit vs by Luthers manner of death and euill life?

For though the prieſthood of the Paſtors of the new law, be not Aaronicall, yet it agreeth with the prieſthood of Aaron, according to S. Paule, in the foreſaid place, that thoſe that come to it, muſt not <hi>take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to themſelues, but muſt be called vnto it as Aaron was,</hi> to wit, viſibly and by peculiar conſecration, and muſt come to it in this ordinarie maner, which our Sauiour termed <hi>to enter in by the doore, Ioh.</hi> 10. to wit, by Chriſt, who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſent his Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Euntes docete omnes gentes, baptizantes eos, &amp;c.

By which words viſibly was giuen to the Apoſtles, both power to abſolue from ſinnes, and a vertuall commandement to the people to make confeſſion to them of all their mortall ſinne: ſince without this confeſſion, they could not tell what to remit, and when to retaine ſinnes. The which Apoſtles, being thus viſibly by our Sauiour called, conſecrated, and ſent, did viſibly, by impoſition of hands, ordeine others their ſucceſſors, and theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from time to time, without interruption, vntill this preſent, men, who now are Prieſts and Paſtors in the Catholicke Romane Church.

And indeed it is a certaine truth, that all true Paſtors in the Church of God, taking vpon them to inſtruct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, muſt haue <hi>a calling</hi> thereunto, and be ſent of God, as the texts alledged do well proue. Heb. 5.4. 2. Chron. 26.18. Mat. 28.19. Ioh. 10.1. and 20.22. And if anie man <hi>leape out of the Church,</hi> forſaking that company wherein lawful ſucceſſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly is, and with the ſucceſſion lawfull ſending fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, he muſt be reputed a hireling that cometh to deſtroy. For this is the touchſtone whereby true teachers are diſcerned, and the contrarie diſcouered. And by this we know the Paſtors of our Church, againſt whom the Ieſuite excepteth, to be legitimate. For the God of heauen ſent them, and when they came, they leaped not out of the Church, otherwiſe then the wheate doth out of the chaffe when it is winnowed, neither did they teach anie thing that was new, or contrarie to the Church, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and reformed the ancient doctrine which the Papacie, in the Church, had corrupted. And let the reader remember, which I haue often anſwered in this booke, that the Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and abuſes of all ſorts; in proceſſe of time, grew, as a leproſie, vpon the Church, and, as I may ſay, incorporated themſelues therewith; by reaſon whereof things good &amp; euill were mingled together, Gods word with mans traditions, the true Sacraments with mans errors, and the externall calling of Miniſters with foule corruptions: in which caſe Luther, and our teachers, renouncing the ſaid errors, traditions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and retaining the reſt, cannot be ſaid to haue gone out of the Church, but to remaine perfectly in it ſtill; becauſe that which they left, was not vniuocally of the church, but only in conceit was reputed ſo. In the Church of Rome, knowne by that name, and in no other, in theſe Weſterne parts, were the true Scriptures, Sacraments, Callings and Succeſſions, &amp; euery part of true faith and neceſſarie doctrine: but theſe things were not the Papacie againſt which we go; the Papacie was, and is, that which ouer and beſides was, by degrees, added to them. And therefore our Paſtors leapt not out of the Church, which
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:1857:246"/> alwayes goeth with the truth, but out of the Papacie; and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by vertue of that externall miſſion which they receiued in the Papacie, they had the vndoubted commiſſion of Chriſt whereto they had right. And euen as when a faire poole of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becometh in time corrupted, weedes grow, the mudde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth; and frogs creepe into it, the owner thereof cutteth a channell, and leauing the corruption drawes the water to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, and ſo occupieth it without danger; and the frogs remaining muſt not complaine the water is theirs, becauſe the pit, wherein they remaine, is it that firſt ingendred it: no more may the Papacy accuſe vs for going out of the church of Rome, as long as we left nothing behind vs but the frogs and weedes; and that which was the ancient water, before they came, we are; whoſe growing vpon vs was the cauſe that we ſeparated, although they ſucceeded in the Church as the weeds and frogs did in the poole.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Ieſuite obiecteth, that <hi>God hath planted a Church, to endure in all ages, wherein he will haue a viſible ſucceſſion of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> preſerued from failing in the true faith; &amp; therefore none are ſent of God but ſuch as come in this ordinarie maner, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſucceeding, viſibly, and with peculiar conſecration, which Chriſt termeth entring in by the doore. The Antecedent whereof is falſe. For though Gods ordinance be that he haue a Church, and teachers therein, in all ages, ſucceeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſtanding in the truth; yet he hath made no law that this ſucceſſion ſhall be <hi>viſible,</hi> or with <hi>peculiar conſecration,</hi> as the Ieſuite meaneth them. For by <hi>viſible</hi> he vnderſtandeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, at al times to all the world, which is a fooliſh aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note n="a" place="margin">§ <hi>17.</hi> And ſo forward to the <hi>24.</hi>

Yea our verie aduerſaries denie not, but a man may be a lawfull Miniſter though a Biſhop neuer conſecrated him; and whereas the common opinion in the Church of Rome is, that a Biſhop differeth not from a Prieſt in order, but in iuriſdiction onely, hence it followeth, vnauoidably, that <hi>iure diuino</hi> a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prieſt, in ſome caſes, may ordaine, becauſe the power of ordaining belongeth not to iuriſdiction but to order, as they call it. The which point will ſerue to auoid all that the Ieſuite hath ſaid in this ſection, though we ſhould ſay no more.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The Texts of Scripture obiected are eaſily anſwered. To that of Heb. 5. I ſay it requireth no more but that the partie be <hi>called of God,</hi> which Luther was, as we know by his labour and the fruite of it, though Luther had alſo a lawfull outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as I haue ſhewed, Sect. 52. num. 5. For the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Chriſt, who yet had none of the peculiar conſecration mentioned by the Ieſuite, but onely a calling from God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe teſtified. All the other places receiue the ſame anſwer. For they mention nothing but a lawfull entrance into the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, containing no one ſillable that bindeth to ſuch an externall kind of ſucceſſion as our aduerſaries call for. Whereupon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Luther and Caluin, and all our ordinarie Paſtours came in by <hi>the doore,</hi> and ſatisfied the whole ordinance of God touching a lawfull calling. For inwardly God enabled them, and opened their eyes to ſee the Romane corruptions; and outwardly they were created Paſtors, and teachers of Diuinity in the Churches where they liued, and where they preached, the magiſtrate authorized, &amp; the people allowed them; which is ſufficient, vnleſſe the doctrine they taught could be diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And if anie other outward ceremonie, or cuſtome, were wanting, which is vſed in the Church of Rome, or hath bene vſed in the purer Church, in former ages; we care not for that, but are readie to maintaine, that, all circumſtances conſidered, no ſuch cuſtome, or ceremonie, is ſimply, and by the law of God, or abſolutely, neceſſarie.</p>

                  <hi>Not one of theſe new Goſpellers was euer able ſo much as to cure a lame colt, or a halting bitch:</hi> and yet when they will flatter the Pope, they ſhame not to write, that all the Apoſtles did as little.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But I will anſwer the Ieſuite directly to the point: that ordinarily it appertaineth to Gods prouidence to furniſh with miracles ſuch as riſe vp in an <hi>extraordinarie</hi> maner, whether it be to abrogate, or alter, the ancient doctrine of his Church, as our Sauiour, and his Apoſtles were furniſhed. And I grant that if Luthers calling were anſwered by vs to be <hi>meerely extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie;</hi> or if he had preached againſt the <hi>Catholicke</hi> Church, or ancient doctrine continued in all ages; the Ieſuite had made a good paſſage againſt vs: but he did none of theſe things. His calling was not <hi>extraordinary</hi> in that kind which reuealeth new doctrine not knowne before, as Chriſts and the Apoſtles was; onely the externall gouernment of the Church being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and oppreſſed by the Papacie, declining from the ancient integritie that was in the beginning, he vſed that calling which he had, and <hi>extraordinarily</hi> bent it to the preaching of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. I ſay <hi>extraordinarily,</hi> firſt becauſe it was not ſo viſibly done in thoſe ages. Next, the corruptions againſt which he dealt were ordinarily embraced in the outward practiſe of the world. Thirdly, he vſed his calling giuen him in the Papacie to another end then they meant that gaue it him. Laſtly, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe times, his eyes, in an extraordinarie meaſure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, were opened to diſcerne the truth, and God enabled him with extraordinarie gifts. In all other things, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly extraordinarie, he differed from the Apoſtles. For neither did he reueale new doctrine, nor want all vocation of men, nor was taught immediatly by reuelation. In which caſe he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:1857:250"/> no miracles, but it was ſufficient for him to proue his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Whereupon the people were bound to credite him, as farre as he taught according to the Scriptures, for they are a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſufficient. And though our Sauiour required no man to beleeue him but vpon the euidence of his <hi>workes,</hi> yet that was becauſe his place was <hi>meerely extraordinarie,</hi> which Luthers was not, whom our Paſtors ſucceeding, they haue the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to proue their calling by the doctrine they teach, and not by miracle. The ordinarie courſe ſet downe by Chriſt was not that which the Papacie practiſed, but the ſame, for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wherein Luther came; the practiſe of the Papacie being a corruption that incroched vpon that courſe, againſt which if Luther preached, he taught nothing contrarie to the ordinary doctrine of the true Church, but contrarie to the Papacie that oppreſſed the Church. Which Papacie, if it could be proued to be the true Church, then according to S. Paule, Gal. 1, <hi>Let him be accurſed that ſpeaketh againſt it,</hi> and as S. Iohn ſpeaketh, Epiſt. 2, <hi>Let no man ſalute</hi> ſuch a preacher, or giue credit to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Let our aduerſaries therefore take notice of their errors, in this point, and diligently marke where they lye. Firſt, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their Papacie to be the <hi>ancient</hi> Church, and the doctrine thereof to be the faith holden, taught, and <hi>alway</hi> deliuered in the ſame, which is falſe &amp; confuted. Then they aſſume againe, that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preaching againſt this their Papacie, preach againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo conſequently are not to be credited, vnleſſe they haue the gift of <hi>miracles.</hi> Thirdly, they inferre vpon this, that therefore all our Paſtors are vnlawfull. The which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtanding vpon ſo weake grounds, can be of no more credit then the grounds are whereupon it ſtandeth: all which I haue ſhewed to be falſe in their owne places where they were to be handled. Let them proue theirs to be the Church, and ſhew that what Luther taught againſt them he taught againſt the Church, and then it will be true that no man ſhould preferre his teaching before them, and not before. Beſide we make not our Paſtors the rule of our faith, but ground our ſelues &amp; them on the Scripture, which is the rule.</p>

For if the Papacy were the truth, God would moue men therunto by ſuch reaſons as were effectuall.

               <p n="3">3 The which thing when Martin Luther and our fathers did, they found out no <hi>new way</hi> of their owne, but opened the old, which the Papacy had forſaken.

For the errors of the Church of Rome are of two ſorts: Some capitall and ſubſtantiall, not onely contrary to the fundamentall articles of our faith needfull to ſaluation, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hindring the meanes and way which God hath appointed, partly without, partly within our ſelues, for the bringing vs thereunto. Of which ſort are the giuing Gods honor to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, iuſtification by workes, merits, the aboliſhing of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and preaching, and ſuch like. Some are not ſo principal, but conſiſt onely in the deniall of ſmaller truths, like the <hi>hay and ſtubble,</hi> which Saint Paul<note n="k" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.12.</note> mentioneth, that is built vpon <hi>the foundation;</hi> and of their owne nature, other circumſtances remoued, deſtroy no article of faith: as praier for the dead, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, faſting daies, vowes, and all thoſe cuſtomes that ſtood onely in rites and ceremonies. Againe, it is one thing to hold an error wilfully and obſtinately, ioyning the profeſſion thereof with the hatred and perſecution of the truth: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to erre ignorantly, being ſeduced by ſuch as teach him, with a mind notwithſtanding alway ready to embrace the truth, whenſoeuer he ſhall be further enlightened. Theſe diſtinctions being premiſed, I anſwer, that in all the time of the Papacy the moſt people erred in the later kind, the greater
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:1857:253"/> errors being either not generally receiued, or not diſtinctly knowne by the people.

And they that will abide therein ſhall find by experience at the laſt, that all the inconueniences which the Ieſuite ſaith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſuch as leaue the Catholicke Church, will fall vpon them. And therefore bleſſed be God the Father of lights who hath reſtored among vs the publicke miniſtery of the Goſpel, for the calling of his people out of the damned errors of the Romane Sea, into his owne Church. And let the earth reioyce and euery child of God therein, and giue him thankes, who hath made the light of his Church to breake out, when the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Church of Rome had thought to haue ſmothered it in eternall darkeneſſe, and with the innumerable errors that it bred, to haue ſeduced, miſled, and drowned it for euer; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by mankinde ſhould haue incurred perdition, death, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe damnation of body and ſoule.

For want of which obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they may, and ſhall periſh eternally, when the faith it ſelfe is in no fault. And let them LABOVR WITH LOVE AND LENITY TO REDVCE AGAINE THEIR SEDVCED NEIGHBOVRS, bearing with their frowardneſſe, and praying inſtantly for their conuerſion, if at any time it may pleaſe God to releaſe them of their errors, and to giue them the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth, by deliuering them from the Romane Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries which haue made them their wards, that they might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe them, and prey vpon them.

            <p>GOod Reader it may fall out, that in the margent of this booke ſpecially, ſome faults are eſcaped in the printing, by mistaking or miſplacing the figures &amp; other parts of the quotation.

It is one thing if I haue wilfully forged or falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a place, and another thing if the Printer onely haue miſtaken the quotation.
